    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, for part of a textbook I&#8217;m helping to write,
I spent some time reading and researching the history of Python as
a scientific computing tool.  I had heard bits and pieces of this in the past,
but it was fascinating to put it all together and learn about how all the
individual contributions that have made Python what it is today.
All of this got me thinking: for most of us, Python was a replacement for
something: IDL, MatLab, Java, Mathematica, Perl&#8230; you name it.
But what will replace Python?
Ten years down the road, what language will people be espousing in
blogs with awkwardly-alliterated titles?  As I thought it through, I
became more and more convinced that, at least in the scientific computing
world, Python is here to stay.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Now I’m not simply talking about inertia.  Javascript has inertia, and that&#8217;s
a main reason that web admins still begrudgingly use it.  But Python is
different.  Yes, it&#8217;s everywhere, and yes, something so ubiquitous is
hard to shake.  But look at the 1970s: punch card programming was
everywhere, and now it&#8217;s nothing but a footnote. Inertia can be overcome
with time.  But I think Python’s hold is much deeper than that: I think it
will remain relevant long into the future.  Here’s why:</p>

<h2>GitHub</h2>

<p>The first reason Python will be around for a while is
<a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.  GitHub has done wonders both for Python
and for the broader open source community.
It has replaced the clunky Trac system of
submitting static patches to projects, and removed the contribution barrier
for the core scientific python projects.  Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib were
all moved to GitHub in late 2010, and the results have been impressive.
I did some quick data mining of the commit logs on GitHub to learn
about the rate of new author contributions to core python projects with
time, and this is what I found:</p>

<p><img src="http://jakevdp.github.com/figures/author_count.png" width="600" title="[Cumulative number of contributors for python packages]" ></p>

<p>See it? The late 2010 transition to GitHub is extremely apparent,
and this reflects the first reason that NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib,
and Python will remain relevant far into the future.
Python not only has an astoundingly large user-base; thanks to GitHub,
it has an astoundingly large and ever-increasing <em>developer</em> base.
And that means Python is well-poised to evolve as the needs of users change.</p>

<h2>Julia</h2>

<p>The second reason Python will be around for a while is
<a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a>.  This statement may strike some as strange:
Julia is a
language which aims to improve on many of Python’s weaknesses.
It uses JIT compilation and efficient built-in array
support to beat Python on nearly every benchmark.  It seems a likely
candidate to <em>replace</em> Python, not a support for my assertion that Python will
remain relevant. But this is the thing: Python’s strength lies in community,
and that community is incredibly difficult to replicate.</p>

<p>A recent
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/julia-dev/YftOOEfcwrk">thread</a>
on the julia-dev list highlights what I’m talking about:
in it, Dag Seljebotn, a core developer of Cython, contrasts the
strengths of Python (large user- and developer-base, large collection of
libraries) with the strengths of Julia (state-of-the-art performance,
JIT compilation).  He
proposes that the two languages should work together, each drawing from the
strengths of the other.  The response from the Julia community was incredibly
positive.</p>

<p>The Julia developers know that Julia can’t succeed as a scientific
computing platform without building an active community, and currently the
best way to do that is to work hand-in-hand with Python.  After this thread
on julia-dev, the Julia  developers were invited to give
<a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/1204/julia-a-fast-dynamic-language-for-technical-comp">a talk</a>
at the Scipy2012 conference,
and I think many would say that some good bridges were built.
I&#8217;m extremely excited about the prospects of Julia as a scientific computing
platform, but it will only succeed if it can embrace Python, and if Python
can embrace it.</p>

<h2>The next Travis Oliphant</h2>

<p>The third reason Python will be around for a while is this: <em>there will be
another Travis Oliphant</em>.  What do I mean by this?  Well, if you go back
ten years or so, the Python scientific community was looking a bit weak.
Numeric was a
well-established array interface, and the beginnings of SciPy were built
upon it.  But Numeric was clunky, so some folks got together and built
Numarray.  Numarray fixed some of the problems, but had its own weaknesses.
The biggest problem, though, was that it split the community:
when the core of your platform has divided allegiances, neither side wins.
Travis realized this, and against the advice of many, audaciously set out
on a quest to unify the two.  The result was NumPy, which is now the
unrivaled basis for nearly all scientific tools in Python.</p>

<p>Python faces a similar crisis today: it is split in the area of
High-performance and parallel computing.  There is an alphabet soup of
packages which aim to address this:
Cython, PyPy, Theano, Numba, Numexpr, and more.  But
here’s the thing: someone <em>will</em> come along who has the audacity to strike
out and unify them.  I love this recent tweet by Dave Warde-Farley:</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/dwf/status/246756226367643650"><img src="http://jakevdp.github.com/images/dwf_tweet.png" width="400" title="[Cumulative number of contributors for python packages]" ></a></p>

<p>Somebody is going to do this: somebody will be the next Travis Oliphant
and create NumTron to re-unite the community.
Maybe Dave will be the next Travis Oliphant:
<a href="http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/">Theano</a> is pretty slick.
But then again, <a href="http://numba.pydata.org/">Numba</a>’s use of LLVM is
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/24/numba-vs-cython/">pretty exciting</a>:
maybe Travis Oliphant will be the next Travis Oliphant.
He’s done it before, after all.  Or perhaps it will be someone
we’ve never heard of, who as we speak is brewing a new idea in
an unwatched GitHub repository&#8230; time will tell.
But I’m confident that it will happen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Maybe I’ve convinced you, maybe I haven’t.  But I’m going to continue using
Python, and I predict you will too.  We&#8217;ll see what the future holds for
scientific computing, but in my mind, Python remains a pretty solid bet.</p>

<p><em>Finally, a brief post-script on the history of Python:
some of the most interesting sources I found were
<a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/pythonP.html">this interview</a> with Guido Van Rossum,
the official <a href="http://www.scipy.org/History_of_SciPy">Scipy history page</a>, the
<a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/1192/matplotlib-lessons-from-middle-age-or-how-you">Scipy2012 talk</a>
John Hunter gave this summer shortly before his sudden passing,
and the <a href="http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2012-February/060640.html">numpy-discussion post</a>
John referenced in his talk.  If you use Python regularly and have some
time, I’d highly recommend browsing these: it’s incredible to see
how the unwavering vision of folks throughout the years has led to what we
have today: an unmatched open-source environment for scientific computing.</em></p>

    <link href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/09/12/dynamic-programming-in-python/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-12T19:02:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/09/12/dynamic-programming-in-python</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Of all the programming styles I have learned,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a>
is perhaps the most beautiful.  It can take problems that, at first glance,
look ugly and intractable, and solve the problem with clean, concise code.
Where a simplistic algorithm might accomplish something by brute force,
dynamic programming steps back, breaks the task into a smaller set of
sequential parts, and then proceeds in the most efficient way possible.</p>

<h3>Bayesian Blocks</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ll go through an example here where the ideas of dynamic programming
are vital to some very cool data analysis resuts.
This post draws heavily from a recent
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012arXiv1207.5578S">paper</a> by Jeff Scargle
and collaborators (this is the Scargle of <em>Lomb-Scargle Periodogram</em>
fame).  The paper discusses
a framework called <em>Bayesian Blocks</em>, which is essentially a method of
creating histograms with bin sizes that adapt to the data (there&#8217;s a bit
more to it than that: here we&#8217;ll focus on histograms for simplicity).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>To motivate this, let&#8217;s take a look at the histogram of some sampled data.
We&#8217;ll create a complicated set of random data in the following way:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now what does this distribution look like?  We can plot a histogram to find
out:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><img src="http://jakevdp.github.com/figures/bayesblocks1.png" title="[Simple Histogram of our Distribution]" ></p>

<p>Not too informative.  The default bins in <code>matplotlib</code> are too wide for this
dataset.  We might be able to do better by increasing the number of bins:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">pl</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hist</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bins</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">normed</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><img src="http://jakevdp.github.com/figures/bayesblocks2.png" title="[More Detailed Histogram of our Distribution]" ></p>

<p>This is better.  But having to choose the bin width each time we plot a
distribution is not only tiresome, it may lead to missing some important
information in our data.  In a perfect world, we&#8217;d like for
the bin width to be learned in an automated fashion, based on the
properties of the data itself.
There have been many rules-of-thumb proposed for this task
(look up <em>Scott&#8217;s Rule</em>, <em>Knuth&#8217;s Rule</em>, the <em>Freedman-Diaconis Rule</em>,
and others in your favorite statistics text).
But all these rules of thumb share a disadvantage: they make the assumption
that all the bins are the same size.  This is not necessarily optimal.  But
can we do better?</p>

<p>Scargle and collaborators showed that the answer is yes.  This is their insight:
For a set of histogram bins or <em>blocks</em>, each of an arbitrary size,
one can use a Bayesian
likelihood framework to compute a <em>fitness function</em> which only depends on
two numbers: the width of each block, and the number of points in each block.
The edges between these blocks (the <em>change-points</em>) can be varied, and
the overall block configuration with the maximum fitness is quantitatively
the best binning.</p>

<p>Simple, right?</p>

<p>Well, no.  The problem is, as the number of points N grows large, the number
of possible configurations grows as 2<sup>N</sup> .  For N=300 points, there are already
more possible configurations than the number of subatomic particles in the
observable universe!  Clearly an exhaustive search will fail in cases of
interest.  This is where <em>dynamic programming</em> comes to the rescue.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Programming</h3>

<p>Dynamic programming is very similar to mathematical proof by induction. By
way of example, consider the formula</p>

<p>$1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.</p>

<p>How could you prove that this is true for all positive integers $n$?
An inductive proof of this formula proceeds in the following fashion:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Base Case</strong>: We can easily show that the formula holds for $n = 1$.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inductive Step</strong>: For some value $k$, assume that
$1 + 2 + \cdots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ holds.
Adding $(k + 1)$ to each side and rearranging the result yields
$1 + 2 + \cdots + k + (k + 1) = \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2}$.  Looking
closely at this, we see that we have shown the following:
if our formula is true for $k$, then it must be true for $k + 1$.</p></li>
<li>By 1 and 2, we can show that the formula is true for any positive integer
$n$, simply by starting at $n=1$ and repeating the inductive step
$n - 1$ times.</li>
</ol>


<p>Dynamic programming proceeds in much the same vein.  In our Bayesian Blocks
example, we can easily find the optimal binning for a single point.  By
making use of some mathematical proofs concerning the fitness functions,
we can devise a simple step from the optimal binning for $k$ points to the
optimal binning for $k + 1$ points (the details can be found in the
appendices of the
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012arXiv1207.5578S">Scargle paper</a>).
In this way, Scargle and collaborators showed that the 2<sup>N</sup> possible states
can be explored in N<sup>2</sup> time.</p>

<h3>The Algorithm</h3>

<p>The resulting algorithm is deceptively simple, but it can be proven to converge
to the single best configuration among the 2<sup>N</sup> possibilities.  Below is the
basic code written in python.  Note that there are a few details that are
missing from this version (e.g. priors on the number of bins, other forms
of fitness functions, etc.) but this gets the basic job done:</p>

<p>The details of the step from $K$ to $K + 1$ may be a bit confusing from this
implementation: it boils down to the fact that Scargle <em>et al.</em> were able to
show that given an optimal configuration of $K$ points, the $(K + 1)$<sup>th</sup>
configuration is limited to one of $K$ possibilities.</p>

<p>The function as written above takes a sequence of points, and returns the
edges of the optimal bins.  We&#8217;ll visualize the result on top of the histogram

<p>The adaptive-width bins lead to a very clean representation of the important
features in the data.  More importantly, these bins are quantifiably optimal,
and their properties can be used to make quantitative statistical
statements about the nature of the data.  This type of procedure has proven
very useful in analysis of time-series data in Astronomy.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ve just scratched the surface of Bayesian Blocks and Dynamic Programming.
Some of the more interesting details of this algorithm require much more
depth: the appendicies of the
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012arXiv1207.5578S">Scargle paper</a>
provide these details.  Dynamic Programming ideas have been shown to be
useful in many optimization problems.  One other example I&#8217;ve worked with
extensively is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra&#8217;s Algorithm</a>
for computing the shortest paths on a connected graph.  This is available in
the <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/csgraph.html">scipy.sparse.csgraph</a>
submodule, which is included in the most recent release of scipy.</p>

<p>The above python implementation of Bayesian Blocks
is an extremely basic form of the algorithm: I plan to include some
more sophisticated options in the python package I&#8217;m currently
working on, called <em>astroML: Machine Learning for Astrophysics</em>.
I&#8217;ll release version 0.1 of astroML at the end of October 2012,
in time to present it at <a href="http://c3.nasa.gov/dashlink/events/1/">CIDU 2012</a>.
If you&#8217;re interested, I&#8217;ll have updates here on the blog, as well as on
my <a href="http://twitter.com/jakevdp">twitter feed</a>.</p>

notebook: <a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/downloads/notebooks/bayesian_blocks.ipynb">bayesian_blocks.ipynb</a>.

    <id>http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/09/05/quantum-python</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial/">previous post</a>
I explored the new animation capabilities of the latest
<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net">matplotlib</a> release.
It got me wondering whether it would be possible to simulate more complicated
physical systems in real time in python.  Quantum Mechanics was the first
thing that came to mind.  It turns out that by mixing a bit of Physics
knowledge with a bit of computing knowledge, it&#8217;s quite straightforward
to simulate and animate a simple quantum mechanical system with python.</p>

<h2>The Schrodinger Equation</h2>

<p>The dynamics of a one-dimensional quantum system are governed by the
time-dependent Schrodinger equation:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
i\hbar\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}
  = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + V \psi
\]</div>




<!-- more -->


<p>The <em>wave function</em> $\psi$ is a function of both position $x$ and time $t$,
and is the fundamental description of the realm of the very small.
Imagine we are following the motion of a single particle in one
dimension.  This wave function represents a probability of measuring
the particle at a position $x$ at a time $t$. Quantum mechanics tells us that
(contrary to our familiar classical reasoning) this probability is not
a limitation of our knowledge of the system, but a reflection of an
unavoidable uncertainty about the position and time of events in the realm
of the very small.</p>

<p>Still, this equation is a bit opaque, but to visualize the results we&#8217;ll need
to solve this numerically.  We&#8217;ll approach this using the split-step Fourier
method.</p>

<h2>The Split-step Fourier Method</h2>

<p>A standard way to numerically solve certain differential equations is
through the use of the Fourier transform.  We&#8217;ll use a Fourier convention
of the following form:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\widetilde{\psi}(k, t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi(x, t) e^{-ikx} dx
\]</div>


<p>Under this convention, the associated inverse Fourier Transform is given by:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\psi(x, t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \widetilde{\psi}(k, t) e^{ikx} dk
\]</div>


<p>Substituting this into the Schrodinger equation and simplifying gives the
Fourier-space form of the Schrodinger equation:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
i\hbar\frac{\partial \widetilde{\psi}}{\partial t}
  = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} \widetilde{\psi}
  + V(i\frac{\partial}{\partial k})\widetilde{\psi}
\]</div>


<p>The two versions of the Schrodinger equation contain an interesting symmetry:
the time step in each case depends on a straightforward multiplication of
the wave function $\psi$, as well as a more complicated term involving
derivatives with respect to $x$ or $k$.  The key observation is that while
the equation is difficult to evaluate fully within one of the forms, each
basis offers a straightforward calculation of one of the two contributions.
This suggests an efficient strategy to numerically solve the Schrodinger
Equation.</p>

<p>First we solve the straightforward part of the $x$-space Schrodinger
equation:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
i\hbar\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}
  = V(x) \psi
\]</div>


<p>For a small time step $\Delta t$, this has a solution of the form</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\psi(x, t + \Delta t) = \psi(x, t) e^{-i V(x) \Delta t / \hbar}
\]</div>


<p>Second, we solve the straightforward part of the $k$-space Schrodinger
equation:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
i\hbar\frac{\partial \widetilde{\psi}}{\partial t}
  = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m} \widetilde{\psi}
\]</div>


<p>For a small time step $\Delta t$, this has a solution of the form</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\widetilde{\psi}(k, t + \Delta t)
    = \widetilde{\psi}(k, t) e^{-i \hbar k^2 \Delta t / 2m}
\]</div>


<h2>Numerical Considerations</h2>

<p>Solving this system numerically will require repeated computations of the
Fourier transform of $\psi(x, t)$ and the inverse Fourier transform of
$\widetilde{\psi}(k, t)$.  The best-known algorithm for computation of
numerical Fourier transforms is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which
is <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/fftpack.html">available in scipy</a>
and efficiently computes the following form of the
discrete Fourier transform:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
  \widetilde{F}_m = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} F_n e^{-2\pi i n m / N}
\]</div>


<p>and its inverse</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
  F_n = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} \widetilde{F}_m e^{2\pi i n m / N}
\]</div>


<p>We need to know how these relate to the continuous Fourier transforms defined
and used above.  Let&#8217;s take the example of the forward transform.  Assume that
the infinite integral is well-approximated by the finite integral from
$a$ to $b$, so that we can write</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\widetilde{\psi}(k, t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
   \int_a^b \psi(x, t) e^{-ikx} dx
\]</div>


<p>This approximation ends up being equivalent to assuming that the potential
$V(x) \to \infty$ at $x \le a$ and $x \ge b$.  We&#8217;ll now approximate this
integral as a Riemann sum of $N$ terms, and define $\Delta x = (b - a) / N$,
and $x_n = a + n\Delta x$:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\widetilde{\psi}(k, t) \simeq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
   \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \psi(x_n, t) e^{-ikx_n} \Delta x
\]</div>


<p>This is starting to look like the discrete Fourier transform!  To bring it
even closer, let&#8217;s define $k_m = k_0 + m\Delta k$, with
$\Delta k = 2\pi / (N\Delta x)$.  Then our approximation becomes</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\widetilde{\psi}(k_m, t) \simeq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
   \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \psi(x_n, t) e^{-ik_m x_n} \Delta x
\]</div>


<p>(Note that just as we have limited the range of $x$ above, we have here limited
the range of $k$ as well.  This means that high-frequency components of the
signal will be lost in our approximation.  The Nyquist sampling theorem tells
us that this is an unavoidable consequence of choosing discrete steps in
space, and it can be shown that the spacing we chose above exactly satisfies
the Nyquist limit if we choose $k_0 = - \pi / \Delta x$).</p>

<p>Plugging our expressions for $x_n$ and $k_m$ into the Fourier
approximation and rearranging, we find the following:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\left[\widetilde{\psi}(k_m, t) e^{i m x_0 \Delta k}\right]
   \simeq \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} 
   \left[ \frac{\Delta x}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
   \psi(x_n, t) e^{-ik_0 x_n} \right]
   e^{-2\pi i m n / N}
\]</div>


<p>Similar arguments from the inverse Fourier transform yield:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\left[\frac{\Delta x}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \psi(x_n, t) e^{-i k_0 x_n}\right]
   \simeq \frac{1}{N} \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} 
   \left[\widetilde{\psi}(k_m, t) e^{-i m x_0 \Delta k} \right]
   e^{2\pi i m n / N}
\]</div>


<p>Comparing these to the discrete Fourier transforms above, we find that the
<em>continuous</em> Fourier pair</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
   \psi(x, t) \Longleftrightarrow \widetilde{\psi}(k, t)
\]</div>


<p>corresponds to the <em>discrete</em> Fourier pair</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
   \frac{\Delta x}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \psi(x_n, t) e^{-i k_0 x_n}
   \Longleftrightarrow
   \widetilde{\psi}(k_m, t) e^{-i m x_0 \Delta k}
\]</div>


<p>subject to the approximations mentioned above.  This allows a fast numerical
evaluation of the Schrodinger equation.</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together: the Algorithm</h2>

<p>We now put this all together using the following algorithm</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Choose $a$, $b$, $N$, and $k_0$ as above, sufficient to represent the
initial state of your wave function $\psi(x)$. (<strong>Warning:</strong> this is perhaps
the hardest part of the entire solution. If limits in $x$ or $k$ are chosen
which do not suit your problem, then the approximations used above can
destroy the accuracy of the calculation!)  Once these are chosen, then
$\Delta x = (b - a) / N$ and $\Delta k = 2\pi / (b - a)$.  Define
$x_n = a + n \Delta x$ and $k_m = k_0 + m \Delta k$.</p></li>
<li><p>Discretize the wave-functions on this grid.  Let $\psi_n(t) = \psi(x_n, t)$,
$V_n = V(x_n)$, and $\widetilde{\psi}_m = \widetilde{\psi}(k_m, t)$.</p></li>
<li><p>To progress the system by a time-step $\Delta t$, perform the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Compute a half-step in $x$:
$\psi_n \longleftarrow \psi_n
 \exp[-i (\Delta t / 2) (V_n / \hbar)]$</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate $\widetilde{\psi}_m$ from $\psi_n$ using the FFT.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute a full-step in $k$:
$\widetilde{\psi}_m \longleftarrow \widetilde{\psi}_m
\exp[-i \hbar (k \cdot k) \Delta t / (2 m)]$</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate $\psi_n$ from $\widetilde{\psi}_m$ using the inverse FFT.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute a second half-step in $x$:
$\psi_n \longleftarrow \psi_n
 \exp[-i (\Delta t / 2)(V_n / \hbar)]$</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Repeat step 3 until the desired time is reached.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Note that we have split the $x$-space time-step into two half-steps: this
turns out to lead to a more stable numerical solution than performing
the step all at once. Those familiar with numerical integration
algorithms may recognize this as an example of the
well-known leap-frog integration technique.</p>

<p>To test this out, I&#8217;ve written a python code which sets up a particle in a
box with a potential barrier.  The barrier is high enough that a classical
particle would be unable to penetrate it.  A quantum particle, however, can
&#8220;tunnel&#8221; through, leading to a non-zero probability of finding the particle
on the other side of the partition.  This quantum tunneling effect lies at
the core of technologies as diverse as electron microsopy, semiconding diodes,
and perhaps even the future of low-powered transistors.</p>

<p>The animation of the result is below (for a brief introduction to the animation
capabilities of python, see

<p>Notice that the height of the potential barrier (denoted by the dashed line in
the bottom panel) is far larger than the energy of the particle.  Still, due
to quantum effects, a small part of the wave function is able to tunnel through
the barrier and reach the other side.</p>

<p>The python code used to generate this animation is included below.  It&#8217;s pretty
long, but I&#8217;ve tried to comment extensively to make the algorithm more clear.
If you&#8217;re so inclined, you might try running the example and adjusting the
potential or the input wave function to see the effect on the dynamics of
the quantum system.</p>

    <updated>2012-08-24T10:41:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/24/numba-vs-cython</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Often I&#8217;ll tell people that I use python for computational analysis, and they
look at me inquisitively.  &#8220;Isn&#8217;t python pretty slow?&#8221;  They have a point.
Python is an interpreted language, and as such cannot natively perform
many operations as quickly as a compiled language such as C or Fortran.
There is also the issue of the oft-misunderstood and much-maligned
<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">GIL</a>,
which calls into question python&#8217;s ability to allow true parallel computing.</p>

<p>Many solutions have been proposed: <a href="http://pypy.org/">PyPy</a> is a much faster
version of the core python language;
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/numexpr/">numexpr</a> provides optimized performance
on certain classes of operations from within python;
<a href="http://www.scipy.org/Weave/">weave</a> allows inline inclusion of compiled
C/C++ code;
<a href="http://www.cython.org/">cython</a> provides extra markup that allows python
and/or python-like code to be compiled into C for fast operations.  But
a naysayer might point out: many of these &#8220;python&#8221; solutions in practice
are not really python at all, but clever hacks into Fortran or C.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I personally have no problem with this. I like python because it gives me a nice
work-flow: it has a clean syntax, I don&#8217;t need to spend my time hunting down
memory errors, it&#8217;s quick to try-out code snippets, it&#8217;s easy to wrap legacy
code written in C and Fortran, and I&#8217;m much more productive when writing
python vs writing C or C++.  <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org">Numpy</a>,
<a href="http://www.scipy.org">scipy</a>, and <a href="http://www.scikit-learn.org">scikit-learn</a>
give me optimized routines for most of what I need to do on a daily basis,
and if something more specialized comes up, cython has never failed me.
Nevertheless, the whole setup is a bit clunky:
why can&#8217;t I have the best of both worlds: a beautiful, scripted, dynamically
typed language like python, with the speed of C or Fortran?</p>

<p>In recent years, new languages like <a href="http://golang.org/">go</a> and
<a href="http://julialang.org/">julia</a> have popped up which try to address some of
these issues.  Julia in particular has a number of nice properties (see the
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCp1jUgVRgE">talk</a> from Scipy 2012 for a
good introduction) and uses <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a> to enable just-in-time
(JIT) compilation and achieve some impressive benchmarks.  Julia holds promise,
but I&#8217;m not yet ready to abandon the incredible code-base and user-base
of the python community.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://numba.pydata.org/">numba</a>.  This is an attempt to bring JIT
compilation cleanly to python, using the LLVM framework.  In a
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/08/memoryview-benchmarks/">recent post</a>, one commenter pointed
out numba as an alternative to cython.  I had heard about it before (See
Travis Oliphant&#8217;s scipy 2012 talk
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYi1cymszqY">here</a>) but hadn&#8217;t had the chance
to try it out until now. Installation is a bit involved, but the directions
on the <a href="http://numba.pydata.org/">numba website</a> are pretty good.</p>

<p>To test this out, I decided to run some benchmarks using the
pairwise distance function I&#8217;ve explored before (see posts
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/08/memoryview-benchmarks/">here</a>
and <a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/16/memoryview-benchmarks-2/">here</a>).</p>

<p>This is a three order-of-magnitude speedup, simply by adding a numba
decorator!</p>

<h3>Cython Version</h3>

<p>For completeness, let&#8217;s do the same thing in cython.  Cython
takes a bit more than just some decorators: there are also type specifiers
and other imports required.  Additionally, we&#8217;ll use the <code>sqrt</code> function
from the C math library rather than from numpy.  Here&#8217;s the code:</p>

<h3>The Takeaway</h3>

<p>So numba is 1000 times faster than a pure python implementation, and only
marginally slower than nearly identical cython code.
There are some caveats here: first of all, I have years of experience with
cython, and only an hour&#8217;s experience with numba.  I&#8217;ve used every optimization
I know for the cython version, and just the basic vanilla syntax for numba.
There are likely ways to tweak the numba version to make it even faster,
as indicated in the comments of
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/08/memoryview-benchmarks/">this post</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, I should say I&#8217;m very impressed.  Using numba, I added
just a <em>single line</em> to the original python code, and
was able to attain speeds competetive with a highly-optimized (and
significantly less &#8220;pythonic&#8221;)  cython implementation.  Based on this,
I&#8217;m extremely excited to see what numba brings in the future.</p>

<p>All the above code is available as an ipython notebook:

    <updated>2012-08-18T08:01:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net">Matplotlib</a> version 1.1 added some tools
for creating
<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/animation_api.html">animations</a>
which are really slick.  You can find some good example animations on
the matplotlib
<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/examples/animation/index.html">examples</a>
page.  I thought I&#8217;d share here some of the things I&#8217;ve learned when playing
around with these tools.</p>

<h3>Basic Animation</h3>

<p>The animation tools center around the <code>matplotlib.animation.Animation</code> base
class, which provides a framework around which the animation functionality
is built.  The main interfaces are <code>TimedAnimation</code> and <code>FuncAnimation</code>,
which you can read more about in the
<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/animation_api.html">documentation</a>.
Here I&#8217;ll explore using the <code>FuncAnimation</code> tool, which I have found
to be the most useful.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First we&#8217;ll use <code>FuncAnimation</code> to do a basic animation of a sine wave moving
across the screen:</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s step through this and see what&#8217;s going on.  After importing required
pieces of <code>numpy</code> and <code>matplotlib</code>, The script sets up the plot:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="n">ax</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">plt</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">axes</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xlim</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">ylim</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">line</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ax</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">plot</span><span class="p">([],</span> <span class="p">[],</span> <span class="n">lw</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here we create a figure window, create a single axis in the figure, and then
create our line object which will be modified in the animation.  Note that
here we simply plot an empty line: we&#8217;ll add data to the line later.</p>

<p>Next we&#8217;ll create the functions which make the animation happen.  <code>init()</code>
is the function which will be called to create the base frame upon which
the animation takes place.  Here we use just a simple function which sets
the line data to nothing.  It is important that this function return the
line object, because this tells the animator which objects on the plot to
update after each frame:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The next piece is the animation function.  It takes a single parameter, the
frame number <code>i</code>, and draws a sine wave with a shift that depends on <code>i</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that again here we return a tuple of the plot objects which have been
modified.  This tells the animation framework what parts of the plot should
be animated.</p>

<p>Finally, we create the animation object:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">anim</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">animation</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">FuncAnimation</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fig</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">animate</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">init_func</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">init</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>                               <span class="n">frames</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">interval</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">blit</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This object needs to persist, so it must be assigned to a variable.  We&#8217;ve
chosen a 100 frame animation with a 20ms delay between frames.  The
<code>blit</code> keyword is an important one: this tells the animation to only re-draw
the pieces of the plot which have changed.  The time saved with <code>blit=True</code>
means that the animations display much more quickly.</p>

<p>We end with an optional save command, and then a show command to show the
result.  Here&#8217;s what the script generates:

<p>This framework for generating and saving animations is very powerful and
flexible: if we put some physics into the <code>animate</code> function, the possibilities
are endless.  Below are a couple examples of some physics animations that
I&#8217;ve been playing around with.</p>

<h3>Double Pendulum</h3>

<p>One of the examples provided on the matplotlib
<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/examples/animation/index.html">example page</a>
is an animation of a double pendulum.  This example operates by precomputing
the pendulum position over 10 seconds, and then animating the results.  I
saw this and wondered if python would be fast enough to compute the dynamics
on the fly.  It turns out it is:</p>

<p>Here we&#8217;ve created a class which stores the state of the double pendulum
(encoded in the angle of each arm plus the angular velocity of each arm)
and also provides some functions for computing the dynamics.  The animation
functions are the same as above, but we just have a bit more complicated
update function: it not only changes the position of the points, but also
changes the text to keep track of time and energy (energy should be constant
if our math is correct: it&#8217;s comforting that it is).  The video below
lasts only ten seconds, but by running the script you can watch the
pendulum chaotically oscillate until your laptop runs out of power:</p>

<h3>Particles in a Box</h3>

<p>Another animation I created is the elastic collisions of a group of particles
in a box under the force of gravity.  The collisions are elastic: they conserve
energy and 2D momentum, and the particles bounce realistically off the walls
of the box and fall under the influence of a constant gravitational force:</p>

<p>The math should be familiar to anyone with a physics background, and the
result is pretty mesmerizing.  I coded this up during a flight, and ended
up just sitting and watching it for about ten minutes.</p>

<p><video width='360' height='270' preload='none' controls poster=' /downloads/videos/particle_box_frame.png'><source src='http://jakevdp.github.com/downloads/videos/particle_box.mp4' type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'/></video></p>

<p>This is just the beginning: it might be an interesting exercise to add
other elements, like computation of the temperature and pressure to demonstrate
the ideal gas law, or real-time plotting of the velocity distribution to
watch it approach the expected Maxwellian distribution.  It opens up many
possibilities for virtual physics demos&#8230;</p>

<h3>Summing it up</h3>

<p>The matplotlib animation module is an excellent addition to what was already
an excellent package.  I think I&#8217;ve just scratched the surface of what&#8217;s
possible with these tools&#8230; what cool animation ideas can you come up
with?</p>

<p>Edit: in a <a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/09/05/quantum-python">followup post</a>, I show how
these tools can be used to generate an animation of a simple Quantum
Mechanical system.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/08/memoryview-benchmarks/">previous post</a>, I explored
how cython typed memoryviews can be used to speed up repeated array
operations.  It became clear that typed memoryviews are superior to
the ndarray syntax for slicing, and as fast as raw pointers for single
element access.  In the comments, Mathieu brought up an interesting
question: is the ndarray syntax as good as typed memoryviews if you&#8217;re
not doing slicing?</p>

<p>The answer turns out to be yes, <em>unless</em> the compiler tries to inline your
function.</p>

<h3>Inlined Memoryview</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ll use a slightly simpler benchmark script here for simplicity.  We&#8217;ll
use inlined typed memoryviews for the inner function, and call this function
within an outer loop:</p>

<p>The inner function is called <code>N</code> times.  We&#8217;ve used the &#8220;inline&#8221; keyword here:
it turns out this is optional with common compiler optimizations turned on.
<code>gcc</code> and other compilers are smart enough to figure out that this function
should be inlined, even if the cython code doesn&#8217;t mark it as such.  Timing
the function on one million loops gives us our comparison benchmark:</p>

<pre><code>%timeit loop_1(1E6)
100000 loops, best of 3: 10.1 us per loop
</code></pre>

<p>Just over a millisecond to perform this loop one million times.</p>

<h3>Non-inlined Memoryview</h3>

<p>Because the compilers are generally so smart, we actually need to be a bit
clever to make sure our function is <em>not</em> inlined.  We&#8217;ll do that through
a switch statement in the loop call, which selects between two possible
inner functions.  This may seem a bit contrived, but it could come up
in practice: for example, if we wanted to create a KDTree for nearest neighbor
searches which can use one of several distance metrics within a single tree
framework, we might be tempted to try a solution like this:</p>

<p>By adding the switch function, it means the compiler cannot know at compile
time which of the inner functions will be used in the loop, and they
cannot be inlined.  The timing results are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>%timeit loop_2(1E6)
10 loops, best of 3: 22.9 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>Using a non-inlined function makes things significantly slower in this case!
So, if you&#8217;re repeatedly calling a small function, inlining can be <em>very</em>
important for optimal execution times.</p>

<h3>The Problem with ndarray</h3>

<p>It turns out that beyond slicing, the problem with the ndarray type is that
multi-dimensional arrays require relatively expensive buffer checks whenever
a function is called.  This causes similar code with ndarrays to be
significantly slower:</p>

<p>Compiling this gives the following warning:</p>

<pre><code>warning: Buffer unpacking not optimized away.
</code></pre>

<p>The result of this buffer unpacking in each loop is a much slower execution
time:</p>

<pre><code>%timeit loop_3(1E6)
1 loops, best of 3: 617 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>This is about 30 times slower than the non-inlined version of the memoryview,
and 6000 times slower than the inlined memoryview above!
Is there any way around this?
Well, there are two options: raw pointers, or explicit inlining in the
code (that is, copying and pasting your code).  Both options will have
speeds similar to that of the inlined memoryviews, but each solution
is inconvenient in its own way.</p>

<p>So why wouldn&#8217;t you use memoryviews?  Well, several projects strive to
remain compatible with python 2.4 (one example is scipy) and python 2.4 is
not compatible with cython&#8217;s typed memoryviews.  Other projects seek to
remain compatible with earlier cython versions which don&#8217;t support
the relatively new memoryview syntax.
In these situations, one of the two partial solutions above
probably need to be used.  In practice, I have usually resorted to passing
around raw pointers.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Here are the timings we found above:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inlined memoryviews: 0.1 ms</li>
<li>Non-inlined memoryviews: 22.9 ms</li>
<li>Inlined ndarray: 617 ms</li>
</ul>


<p>So we see yet another reason that typed memoryviews are superior to
the ndarray syntax: they not only have very speedy slicing, but also
play well with the compiler&#8217;s inlining optimization.  Granted, these
time differences will be insignificant if your inlined function does
some non-negligible amount of computation, but there may be situations
where this affects things.</p>

<h3>Back to my problem</h3>

<p>If you recall, I started all of this because I wanted to create a binary tree
that can compute pairwise distances with arbitrary distance metrics.  Where
do these results put me?  Not in a great position, it turns out.  Abstracting
out the distance function so that the same machinery can be used with
different functions will lead to speed penalties from the inability to inline.
C++ libraries accomplish this through compile-time conditionals (i.e. templates)
but cython doesn&#8217;t have this capability.  Duplicating the tree
framework with a new hard-coded (and thus inlinable) distance metric may
be the only option.  That, or wrapping a templated C++ implementation.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There was recently a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/cython-users/8uuxjB_wbBQ[1-25]" title="cython-users archive">thread</a>
on cython-users which caught my eye.  It has to do with
<a href="http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/memoryviews.html">memoryviews</a>, a new
way of working with memory buffers in cython.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking recently about how to do fast
and flexible memory buffer access in cython.  I contributed the
<a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.BallTree.html">BallTree</a>
implementation for nearest neighbors searching in
<a href="http://www.scikit-learn.org">scikit-learn</a>, and have been actively thinking
about how to make it faster and more flexible, including adding the ability
to specify distance metrics other than euclidean and minkowski.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish this, I&#8217;d like to have a set of distance metric
functions which take two vectors and compute a distance.  There would
be many functions with similar call signatures which could then be
plugged into a code that would iterate over a set of vectors and
compute the appropriate distances.</p>

<h3>Pure python version</h3>

like this:</p>

<p>This looks promising.  Let&#8217;s create a function based on this which will compute
the pairwise distance between all points in a matrix (this is similar
to <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances.html">pairwise_distances</a> in scikit-learn or
<a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.pdist.html">pdist</a> in scipy).  The simple form of the function might look
like this:</p>

<p>We could exploit symmetry to reduce the number of computations required, but
we&#8217;ll skip that step for now: this simple version of the function will give
us a good benchmark for comparison with alternatives below.  Using the
<code>timeit</code> magic in ipython, we can learn how fast this implementation is:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: import numpy as np

In [2]:from memview_bench_v1 import pairwise

In [3]: X = np.random.random((500, 3))

In [4]: timeit pairwise(X)
1 loops, best of 3: 6.51 s per loop
</code></pre>

<p>It takes nearly seven seconds to compute 250,000 distances.  This is much
too slow.</p>

<h3>Cython Speedup</h3>

<p>Perhaps we can speed this up using cython declarations.  Before typed
memoryviews were added in cython 0.16, the way to quickly index numpy
arrays in cython was through the numpy specific syntax, adding type
information to each array that specifies its data type, its dimension, and
its order:</p>

<p>Notice that we&#8217;re essentially running the same code, except we have added
type identifiers to speed up function calls and loops.  The <code>mode='c'</code>
argument in the <code>np.ndarray</code> type says that the array is contiguous in
memory, and C-ordered.</p>

<p>For reference, this can be compiled in-place by running
<code>python setup.py build_ext --inplace</code> with the following

<p>We&#8217;ll time the resulting function on the same sized array as we did previously:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: import numpy as np

In [2]: from memview_bench_v2 import pairwise

In [3]: X = np.random.random((500, 3))

In [4]: timeit pairwise(X)
1 loops, best of 3: 668 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s a factor of 10 speedup over the pure python version!  It turns out,
though, that we can do better.  In particular, the slicing operation when
we call <code>X[i]</code> and <code>X[j]</code> must generate a new numpy array each time, which
leads to a lot of python overhead in reference counting, etc.  This is the
reason that the cython team introduced typed memoryviews in cython v0.16.</p>

<h3>Typed Memoryviews</h3>

<p>The only change is that instead of using the <code>np.ndarray[...]</code> type specifier,
we use the typed memoryview <code>double[:, ::1]</code> specifier.  The <code>::1</code> in the
second position means that we are passing a two-dimensional array, which
is contiguous and C-ordered.  We time the results and see the following:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: import numpy as np

In [2]: from memview_bench_v3 import pairwise

In [3]: X = np.random.random((500, 3))

In [4]: timeit pairwise(X)
10 loops, best of 3: 22 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>This gives another factor of 30 improvement over the previous version, simply
by switching to typed memoryviews rather than the numpy interface.  Still,
our function is creating memoryview objects each time we slice the array.  We
can determine how much overhead this is generating by using raw C pointers
instead.  It is not as clean, but it should be very fast:</p>

<h3>Raw Pointers</h3>

<p>The fundamental benchmark for this sort of operation should be working
directly with the pointers themselves.  While this is not a very &#8220;pythonic&#8221;
way of doing things, it does lead to very fast code, as we will see:</p>

<p>Instead of passing around slices of arrays, we&#8217;ve accessed the raw memory
buffer using C pointer syntax.  This is not as easy to read, and can lead
to <code>glibc</code> errors or segmentation faults if we&#8217;re not careful.  Testing
this implementation, we find that it is extremely fast:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: import numpy as np

In [2]: from memview_bench_v4 import pairwise

In [3]: X = np.random.random((500, 3))

In [4]: timeit pairwise(X)
100 loops, best of 3: 2.47 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>This is another factor of 10 faster than the memoryview benchmark above!
Essentially, what this is telling us is that creating a memoryview slice
takes about 0.02 / 500,000 = 40 nanoseconds on our machine.  This is extremely
fast, but because we&#8217;re performing this operation half a million times, the
cost of the allocations is significant compared to the rest of our
computation.  If our vectors were, say, length 1000, this cost may not be
a significant percentage of the total cost.</p>

<p>So what are we left with?  Do we need to use raw pointers in all circumstances
when working with collections of small vectors?  Perhaps not.</p>

<h3>A Faster Implementation with Memoryviews</h3>

<p>The creation of memoryview slices, though extremely fast, is causing a problem
simply because we&#8217;re creating so many slices.  Here is an alternative which
uses no raw pointers, but matches the speed of raw pointers:</p>

<p>Timing this implementation we find the following:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: import numpy as np

In [2]: from memview_bench_v5 import pairwise

In [3]: X = np.random.random((500, 3))

In [4]: timeit pairwise(X)
100 loops, best of 3: 2.45 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>Just as fast as using raw pointers, but much cleaner and easier to read.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Here are the timing results we&#8217;ve seen above:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Python + numpy</strong>: 6510 ms</li>
<li><strong>Cython + numpy</strong>: 668 ms</li>
<li><strong>Cython + memviews (slicing)</strong>: 22 ms</li>
<li><strong>Cython + raw pointers</strong>: 2.47 ms</li>
<li><strong>Cython + memviews (no slicing)</strong>: 2.45 ms</li>
</ul>


<p>So what have we learned here?  First of all, typed memoryviews are fast.
Blazing fast.  If used correctly, they can be comparable to raw pointers,
but are much cleaner easier to debug.  For example, in the last
version, if we ran into a memory error we could simply turn on bounds-checking
and quickly find the source of the problem.  Slicing with memoryviews is
also fast, but should be used carefully if your operation time on each slice
is compararable to the cost of building the slice.</p>

<p>The moral of the story?  <em>Use typed memoryviews.</em>  It will lead to fast cython
code which is cleaner, more readable, and more easily debuggable than any other
alternative.</p>
