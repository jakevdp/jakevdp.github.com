    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been just over four years since the introduction of Python 3, and there
are still about as many opinions on it as there are Python users.  For
those who haven&#8217;t been following, Python 3 is a release
which offers several nice improvements over the 2.x series
(summarized <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.0.html">here</a>)
with the distinct disadvantage that it broke backward compatibility:
though Python 3.x (often referred to as &#8220;Py3k&#8221; for short)
is true to the spirit of earlier Python versions,
there are a few valid 2.x constructions which will not parse under 3.x.</p>

<p>Breaking backward compatibility was controversial, to say the least.  I
think of the debate as one between the pragmatists &#8211; those who see Python
as an extremely useful tool, which should not be unnecessarily tampered with &#8211;
and the idealists &#8211; those who view the Python language
as a living, breathing entity, which should be allowed to grow into the
fullest and most Pythonic possible version of itself.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The scientific Python community has largely leaned to the pragmatist side.  Some
of this is due to the pragmatism inherent to science (in the publish-or-perish
world, one does not often have time for idealistic thinking about one&#8217;s tools),
and some of this is due to institutional pressures, which I&#8217;ll mention below.
But regardless of the cause, the scientific Python community has been
particularly slow in moving to Py3k.  <a href="http://www.numpy.org">Numpy</a>, the
core of the scientific Python ecosystem, first supported Py3k in version
1.5, released in 2010, nearly two years after the release of Py3k.
<a href="http://www.scipy.org">Scipy</a> followed suit with version 0.9
in March 2011.  <a href="http://www.ipython.org">IPython</a> added Py3k support
with version 0.12 in December 2011.  The final holdout among
the core scientific packages was matplotlib, which now supports Py3k in the
1.2 release as of November 2012.</p>

<p>The casual observer might look at this progress
and infer that the transition is near
complete: scientists can now start moving to Py3k without fear of losing
access to the tools of their trade.  But in reality, nothing could be further
from the truth.  Consider that the Numpy and Scipy development teams only
last month made the decision to drop support for Python 2.4 (which was first
released in March of 2005).  Even then, there has been considerable talk of how
to make sure the final 2.4-compatible release is long-term-stable for those
users who will use 2.4 well into the future (many institutional Linux
distributions, such as Red Hat Linux, are very slow to update their
native Python version).
All else being equal, we might extrapolate and say that support for Python 2.7
(first released in July 2010) might be dropped by mid 2018.  But this would
be an overly simplistic expectation, for reasons I&#8217;ll outline below.
There&#8217;s a vital component of this transition that I haven&#8217;t yet heard
mentioned by anyone else:
I would argue that the main limitation to the adoption of Python 3
by the scientific community lies in <em>the lack of a well-developed 3-to-2
conversion tool</em>.  I&#8217;ll explain this thought below.</p>

<h2>The Types of Users</h2>

<p>To begin to evaluate what it will take for the
scientific community to transition to
Python 3, I&#8217;d like to divide members of the community into three general
categories.  These are certainly not mutually exclusive (I fall pretty
squarely in all three), but the categories will
help us think about the forces involved in the
decision to switch to Py3k.  The groups are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Individual Scientists</strong> are the researchers who primarily use
Python for their own individual tasks: statistical analysis of their data,
creation of figures, and writing scripts to stitch together various legacy
codes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Institutional Scientists</strong> are the researchers who are part of a large
research team or collaboration with a common Python code-base.  An example
that I personally am
familiar with is the <a href="http://www.lsst.org">LSST</a> collaboration:
the LSST software stack has been developed by a large team over the course
of several years, and is written primarily in C++ and Python 2.x.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scientific Python Developers</strong>
are the scientists who may be part of one or both of the above groups,
but also go the extra mile and contribute to the packages that
make the scientific Python ecosystem what it is.  I wouldn&#8217;t limit this to
just the NumPy/SciPy/IPython/Matplotlib packages mentioned above, but also
the expanding circle of packages geared toward specific fields and
applications.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Members of these three groups have very different needs and constraints that
will affect how easily they can move to Py3k:</p>

<h3>Individual Scientists</h3>

<p>This group is probably the most flexible of the three, and for that reason
are perhaps the lowest-hanging fruit of the bunch.
Free from the constraints of a large legacy
code-base, they can adopt Py3k virtually at-will.  I witnessed
a similar transition take place
over the course of my graduate schooling at University of Washington: at the
beginning of my PhD program, nearly everybody in the department was
using the proprietary language <a href="http://www.exelisvis.com/idl/">IDL</a>.
By the time I graduated,
close to half the department was primarily using Python.</p>

<p>As much as I&#8217;d like
to take some of the credit for that transition (I was a tireless proseletizer
of the virtues of Python over IDL),
it likely had more to do with the adoption of
Python by several important astronomical research collaborations, as well
as the influence of several newer professors who recommended Python to
their advisees.  This points to the fact that
although an individual could easily upgrade to Py3k virtually at
will, in practice it is unlikely to happen unless others around them have
begun to do so as well.</p>

<h3>Institutional Scientists</h3>

<p>As hinted above, even the most independent scientists are not entirely
insulated from their colleagues, and the tools chosen by influential
members of their team will affect their choice of tools for their own tasks.
But aside from this peer pressure, scientists who are part of a large
collaboration are additionally constrained by the countless hours
already invested in their present code-base. And if that code-base is
in Python 2.x, it will take a lot more than some unicode and iterator
enhancements to effect a transition to Python 3.</p>

<p>Because of this, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of incredulity (and even some
anger) about the decision of the Python core devs to move forward with a
backward-incompatible release.  In a conversation, one Princeton
astrophysicist I know (who is famous for &#8211; among other things &#8211;
the brashness of his opining) called
the py3k release &#8220;utterly inane&#8221;, and went on to say that astronomy will
<em>never</em> adopt Python 3.  I&#8217;m a bit more optimistic myself, but this is
indicative of the general attitude toward Py3k within the scientific
community.</p>

<h3>Scientific Python Developers</h3>

<p>Those scientists who take the time to contribute to the greater community are
a bit of a special case.  They tend to be less pragmatic about Python than
their peers, and may have some silly hobbies (like using their free time
to write blog posts with &#8220;Python&#8221; in the title).
They are generally comfortable using multiple Python installs
on each of their several computers, and as such are less influenced by the
preferences of whatever research group they may be in at the time.
Yet even this group is unlikely to be using Python 3.x currently.
It might be because Matplotlib &#8211; a core scientific tool &#8211; only just moved
to Py3k compatibility, but I think it&#8217;s even deeper than that.  I, for one,
did not jump up to make the switch the minute the matplotlib 1.2 announcement
came out, and I doubt that others did either.</p>

<p>The core of the problem is this: even though NumPy/SciPy/IPython/Matplotlib
are compatible with Py3k, the <em>development</em> still takes place in Python 2.x.
The Py3k compatibility is bootstrapped in using
<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/2to3">2to3</a>
and other scripts of that ilk.  And herein lies the problem:
absent another compelling reason, as long as the development takes place
in Python 2.x, these developers will be very unlikely to move
their own work to Py3k.</p>

<h2>The Outlook</h2>

<p>Exploring the needs and drivers of these three groups paints a pretty dim
picture for Py3k in the scientific world.
Individuals have no pressure to switch, and
collaborations become so entrenched that switching is near impossible.
Even those who are actively contributing to the Numpy and Scipy codebases
cannot use Python 3 for this task, and thus have no big driver for change.
This final piece holds perhaps the biggest opportunity,
because the Scientific Python developers have the potential
to catalyze change in the rest of the community: these are the folks who write
the online Python documentation and tutorials; they give talks and tutorials
at <a href="http://conference.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, <a href="http://www.pydata.org">PyData</a>,
<a href="http://www.pycon.org">PyCon</a>,
and conferences specific to their own field; they influence the
curricula used in Python bootcamps like those facilitated by
<a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">Software Carpentry</a>.  In short, perhaps the
sole hope of moving the scientific community to Python 3 lies in the
scientific python developers.  Move the <em>development</em> of Numpy, Scipy, IPython,
Matplotlib, and other core packages to Python 3, and the rest of the
community will follow.</p>

<p>The problem is, this is impossible right now.  Realistically, Python 2.x will
have to be supported by Numpy and Scipy for at least another decade.
If Numpy &amp; Scipy development is to be moved to Py3k, what is needed is a
fully-developed, mature 3-to-2 conversion tool which can convert 3.x back as
far as Python 2.5.  With this, development could continue in Py3k while still
maintaining 2.x support.  A basic form of such a tool
<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/3to2">is available</a>, but it is not nearly
as mature (nor as easy a task)
as the <a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/2to3">2to3</a> tool.
The tool&#8217;s relative immaturity
is understandable: converting the new to the old is not nearly as sexy as
converting the old to the new.  But for the reasons I outlined above, I
believe it to be vital.</p>

<p>So here&#8217;s my challenge to any Python idealists out there:
<em>if you want the scientific community to ever fully adopt Python 3,
prioritize the development of a full-featured 3to2 tool,
and start doing all you can to encourage NumPy to move to
developing in Py3k</em>.  I&#8217;d do it myself, but I&#8217;m too much of
a pragmatist: python 2.7 is more than sufficient for my own research.
But I&#8217;d be willing to bet &#8211; if someone does this, the rest of us will
soon follow.</p>

    <updated>2012-12-19T08:21:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/12/19/sparse-svds-in-python</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="http://fseoane.net/blog/2012/singular-value-decomposition-in-scipy/">Fabian&#8217;s post</a> on the topic, I have recently returned to thinking about the
subject of sparse singular value decompositions (SVDs) in Python.</p>

<p>For those who haven&#8217;t used it, the SVD is an extremely powerful technique.
It is the core routine of many applications,
from filtering to dimensionality
reduction to graph analysis to supervised classification and much, much more.</p>

<p>I first came across the need for a fast sparse SVD when applying a technique
called Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) to astronomy spectra: it was the first
astronomy paper I published, and you can read it <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AJ....138.1365V">here</a>.  In LLE, one visualizes the nonlinear relationship
between high-dimensional observations.  The computational cost is extreme: for
<em>N</em> objects, one must compute the null space (intimately related to the SVD)
of a <em>N</em> by <em>N</em> matrix.  Using direct methods (e.g. LAPACK), this can scale
as bad as <em>O[N<sup>3</sup> ]</em> in both memory and speed!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I needed a better option.  I came across the package
<a href="http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/">ARPACK</a>, a well-tested
implementation of iterative Arnoldi Factorization written in Fortran.
The shift-invert mode of ARPACK served my needs, so I spent some time
extending the <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/arpack.html">scipy ARPACK wrapper</a> so I could address my problem.  I also helped
Fabian and others implement the beginnings of the <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/dev/modules/manifold.html">manifold learning</a> module in scikit-learn.</p>

<p>Even after moving on to other problems, I found that
the SVD was at the core of nearly every component of my research
while working toward my PhD.  You can see this in
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AAS...21715304C">several</a>
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011ApJ...727..118V">other</a>
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011AJ....142..203D">projects</a>
I was involved with over the years, including my
<a href="http://gradworks.umi.com/35/42/3542228.html">PhD Thesis</a>, which centered
on Astronomical applications of Karhunen-Loeve analysis &#8211; a method, again,
intimately linked with the SVD.</p>

<p>Hopefully this brief tour has convinced you of the power of the SVD in
addressing real research problems.  Now to the code.</p>

<h1>Sparse SVD Implementations</h1>

<p>What I didn&#8217;t know at the time I worked on the ARPACK wrapper is that there
are several more good options available for computing SVDs - and most now have
passable Python wrappers which integrate well with scipy&#8217;s sparse matrices.
I&#8217;ll briefly describe them here.</p>

<h2>LAPACK</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.netlib.org/lapack/">LAPACK</a>
is the standard specification of efficient linear algebra routines
across computing systems, and contains routines to
compute a direct (i.e. non-iterative)
SVD of a dense matrix.  The performance of LAPACK varies from system to
system, and implementation to implementation.  The algorithm is generally
<em>O[N<sup>3</sup> ]</em>, and partial decompositions are (in general) not available.  Though
not technically the same, I would group alternatives like
<a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/">ATLAS</a> (an optimized open-source
matrix library) and <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl">MKL</a>
(Intel&#8217;s proprietery library for fast numerics) in the same category.
I don&#8217;t have much personal experience with MKL, so if I&#8217;m not doing it justice,
please feel free to admonish me in the comments!</p>

<p>LAPACK is wrapped by Numpy and Scipy, and is
at the core of many of the routines in <code>numpy.linalg</code> and
<code>scipy.linalg</code>, including the <code>svd</code> function in each.</p>

<h2>ARPACK</h2>

<p>As I mentioned above, <a href="http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/">ARPACK</a>
implements a fast iterative/partial eigenvalue decomposition on a general
linear operator.  One of its strengths is that unlike LAPACK, it does not
depend on your matrix being stored in any standard layout: all that is required
is to provide a routine which implements matrix-vector multiplication.  This
means that as well as dense matrices, ARPACK can be used on any sparse matrix
or even a general linear operator which maps one vector space to another.</p>

<p>ARPACK does not have a native SVD implementation, but it is possible to
exploit the relationship between eigenvalue decompositions and singular
value decompositions to compute an ARPACK svd: this is what the current
<code>svds</code> routine in <code>scipy.sparse.linalg</code> does: see the documentation
<a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.linalg.svds.html">here</a>.  One issue with this implementation is that to compute the SVD of
a matrix <em>M</em>, it must implicitly compute <em>M<sup>T</sup> M</em>,
and that may lead to issues of both
numerical accuracy and computational efficiency.</p>

<h2>SVDLIBC</h2>

<p>Before Fabian&#8217;s blog post, mentioned above, I had never heard of
<a href="http://tedlab.mit.edu/~dr/SVDLIBC/">SVDLIBC</a>.  It
is also an Arnoldi-iteration based implementation, but SVDLIBC requires a
specific sparse matrix format to operate.  Fortunately for scipy users, this
storage format maps directly to the CSC sparse matrix format, so the SVDLIBC
svd can be computed without any memory copies of the scipy matrix (assuming,
of course, your matrix is already stored as CSC or CSR!).  A bare-bones python
wrapper for the routine exists in the <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/sparsesvd/">sparsesvd</a> package.</p>

<h2>PROPACK</h2>

<p><a href="http://soi.stanford.edu/~rmunk/PROPACK/">PROPACK</a> is another well-tested
Fortran package which computes the SVD directly using an Arnoldi Factorization
scheme: like ARPACK, it only depends on a callback implementing left- and
right-multiplication operations, rather than making use of any specific
sparse storage format.  Like SVDLIBC, it  computes the svd directly, saving
computation time and leading to greater numerical accuracy.  From my brief
search, it seems that
no python wrapper is readily available (though I heard that David Cournapeau
had worked on one).  Until recently, the PROPACK license was unspecified,
precluding its inclusion in Scipy or other BSD-licensed packages.  It appears
that just recently, PROPACK itself was moved to a BSD license, so there is
now the possibility of including it in the Scipy universe.</p>

<p>I have begun working on a full-featured PROPACK wrapper in the Scipy style,
using the excellent F2Py Fortran interface generator.  You can find the
code in my <a href="https://github.com/jakevdp/pypropack">pypropack repository</a>
on Github.  As of this writing, there is still a lot to do to make the
code releasable, but there is enough there to enable some quick benchmarks.</p>

<h1>Benchmark Comparisons</h1>

<p>This creates square sparse matrices, measures the computation time as a function
of the matrix size, and plots the results.  The results on my 3-year old
linux box are below:</p>

<p><img src="http://jakevdp.github.com/figures/svd_benchmarks.png" title="[SVD benchmarks]" ></p>

<p>A few comments: First, as expected, LAPACK is much slower than the rest.  This
is due to two factors: first, LAPACK computes the full SVD, while the other
methods compute only partial SVDs (the <em>k=5</em> largest singular values).
Second, the LAPACK on my system is not
well-optimized: I could probably reduce this by at least an order of magnitude
if I were to use an ATLAS install optimized for my system.  If you need a
full SVD, it will be hard to beat LAPACK/ATLAS/MKL in terms of speed (but
in terms of memory consumption, as
<a href="http://fseoane.net/blog/2012/singular-value-decomposition-in-scipy/">Fabian showed</a>,
LAPACK can be pretty bad).  Because SVDLIBC, ARPACK, and PROPACK all use
Lanczos/Arnoldi iteration, they should all similarly out-perform LAPACK on
the memory question.</p>

<p>Second, the good performance of SVDLIBC for small matrices is probably due to
its direct use of the CSC memory within the Fortran code.  For matrices this
size, the Python overhead of invoking the callback in ARPACK and PROPACK kills
any performance gains from the more sophisticated algorithms.  As the matrices
grow, we see that ARPACK and PROPACK begin to out-perform SVDLIBC.</p>

<p>Finally, we see that for these test cases, PROPACK is consistently
faster than ARPACK by a factor of 5 or so: nothing to scoff at!
I haven&#8217;t rigorously tested the claims of increased numerical stability
in PROPACK, but those two pieces point to PROPACK as the
preferred method by far.</p>

<h1>Next Steps</h1>

<p>I hope to continue developing the <code>pypropack</code> wrapper on github, and once
I&#8217;m happy with it, incorporate it into Scipy&#8217;s sparse linear algebra tools.
I would love help with this: in particular, if there are any F2Py wizards out
there, I&#8217;m currently having what I think is a
<a href="https://github.com/jakevdp/pypropack/issues/1">memory issue</a>
with the callback function that I can&#8217;t seem to track down.</p>

<p>Hopefully this post has helped convince you of the importance of SVDs in
scientific computing, and also of the benefits of working on PROPACK
incorporation in the scientific Python universe.  This sort of thing
won&#8217;t happen unless someone like <strong>you</strong> decides to work on it!  That
fact ends up being both a weakness and an incredible strength of
open-source packages.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

    <updated>2012-12-06T18:23:00-08:00</updated>
    <id>http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/12/06/minesweeper-in-matplotlib</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been playing around with interactivity in matplotlib.  A couple
weeks ago, I discussed briefly how to use event callbacks to implement
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/11/24/simple-3d-visualization-in-matplotlib/">simple 3D visualization</a>
and later used this as a base for creating a
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/11/26/3d-interactive-rubiks-cube-in-python">working 3D Rubik&#8217;s cube</a>
entirely in matplotlib.</p>

<p>Today I have a different goal: re-create
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_%28computer_game%29">minesweeper</a>,
that ubiquitous single-player puzzle game that most of us will admit to
having binged on at least once or twice in their lives.  In minesweeper, the
goal is to discover and avoid hidden mines within a gridded minefield, and
the process takes some logic and quick thinking.</p>

<p><img src="http://jakevdp.github.com/images/minesweeper_2.gif" width="800"></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>To implement this in matplotlib, at its most stripped-down level, simply
requires us to register mouse clicks on the plot window, and to have the
window respond in the appropriate way.  The rest is just the logic underneath.</p>

<h2>Event Callbacks</h2>

<p>Matplotlib contains several built-in event callbacks.  You can register
key presses (with <code>'key_press_event'</code> and <code>'key_release_event'</code>),
mouse clicks (with <code>'button_press_event'</code> and <code>'button_release_event'</code>),
mouse movement (with <code>'motion_notify_event'</code>), and much more.  For
a full listing of the events that can be bound to functionality, see the
documentation of the function <code>'matplotlib.pyplot.connect'</code>.</p>

<p>As a simple example, here we&#8217;ll create a polygon and a function which is called
each time the axis is clicked.  The function <code>on_click</code> checks if the click
occured within the polygon, and if so changes the polygon to a random
color:</p>

<p>The result will look something like this:</p>

<p>Checking whether a click event is within a polygon or any other artist is
a very common pattern.  For this reason, matplotlib provides a built-in
 <code>pick</code> event.  You can think of this as an event similar to a mouse click,
but specifically generated by a plot artist when it is clicked.
Furthermore, a <code>pick</code> event is associated back to that particular plot
element, which can be easily referenced within the callback.
Here is a code snippet which gives is equivalent to the code above,
but uses pick events rather than button press events:</p>

<p>Here we have used just a single polygon, but there&#8217;s nothing to stop us
from using multiple interactive polygons in a single window.  Add some
logic beneath it all, and the results can be extremely flexible.  We&#8217;ll
go through one in-depth example below.</p>

<h2>Minesweeper</h2>

<p>Using this simple machinery, let&#8217;s create a basic implementation of the game
Minesweeper.  This involves creating a grid of polygons, with a certain number
of them &#8220;containing&#8221; mines.  Clicking the left mouse button will &#8220;uncover&#8221;
the square, ending the game if a mine is underneath.  If (as we&#8217;d hope)
an uncovered square does not contain a mine, it will reveal a number
reporting how many of the eight adjacent squares contain mines.
The right mouse button is used to mark where we believe mines are.</p>

<p>There are some other more sophisticated features in the below code &#8211;
for example, clicking
an already uncovered square with the correct number of adjacent mines marked
will automatically clear the surrounding squares &#8211; but rather than enumerating
every programming decision, I&#8217;ll just show you the code.  It&#8217;s less than
200 lines, but the results are pretty nice:</p>

<p>There are still some things missing from this which are present in any good
minesweeper implementation: a timer, the ability to reset the game without
restarting the program, the ability to keep track of fastest times, and
likely some more things I haven&#8217;t thought of.</p>

<p>Regardless, this little script shows how incredibly powerful a framework
matplotlib is.
It can create an interactive Rubik&#8217;s cube one day, publication-quality plots
the next, and round out the season with a blast back to a classic Windows 3.1
time-sink.  And for some reason, I find I have much more fun playing the
minesweeper I built from scratch than the one that came with my system.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>Most readers are aware that Python is an object-oriented language.  By
object-oriented, we mean that Python can define <em>classes</em>, which bundle
<strong>data</strong> and <strong>functionality</strong> into one entity.  For example, we may
create a class <code>IntContainer</code> which stores an integer and allows
certain operations to be performed:</p>

<p>This is a bit of a silly example, but shows the fundamental nature of
classes: their ability to bundle data and operations into a single
<em>object</em>, which leads to cleaner, more manageable, and more adaptable code.
Additionally, classes can inherit properties from parents and add or
specialize attributes and methods.  This <em>object-oriented</em>
approach to programming can be very intuitive and powerful.</p>
<p>What many do not realize, though, is that quite literally
<a href="http://www.diveintopython.net/getting_to_know_python/everything_is_an_object.html"><em>everything</em></a>
in the Python language is an object.</p>

the built-in <code>int</code> type:</p>

<p>Yes, you read that correctly:
the type of <code>type</code> is <code>type</code>.  In other words, <code>type</code> is <em>an
instance of itself</em>.  This sort of circularity cannot (to my knowledge)
be duplicated in pure Python, and the behavior is created through a bit of a
hack at the implementation level of Python.</p>

<p>Now that we&#8217;ve stepped back and considered the fact that classes in Python

return objects.  We can think of these functions as an object factory: they

the function <code>class_factory</code> constructs and returns an instance of <code>type</code>:

  Conclusion: When Should You Use Metaclasses?
</h2>
</div>
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>I&#8217;ve gone through some examples of what metaclasses are, and some ideas 
about how they might be used to create very powerful and flexible APIs. 
Although metaclasses are in the background of everything you do in Python,
the average coder rarely has to think about them.</p>
<p>But the question remains: when should you think about using custom
metaclasses in your project?  It&#8217;s a complicated question, but
there&#8217;s a quotation floating around the web
that addresses it quite succinctly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Metaclasses are deeper magic than 99% of users should ever worry about.
If you wonder whether you need them, you don’t (the people who actually
need them know with certainty that they need them, and don’t need an
explanation about why).</p>
<p>– Tim Peters</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a way, this is a very unsatisfying answer: it&#8217;s a bit reminiscent of
the wistful and cliched explanation of the border between attraction
and love: &#8220;well, you just&#8230; know!&#8221;</p>
<p>But I think Tim is right: in general,
I&#8217;ve found that most tasks in Python that can be accomplished through
use of custom metaclasses can also be accomplished more cleanly and with
more clarity by other means.  As programmers, we should always be careful
to avoid being clever for the sake of cleverness alone, though
it is admittedly an ever-present temptation.</p>
<p>I personally spent six years doing science with Python, writing code
nearly on a daily basis, before I found a problem for which metaclasses
were the natural solution.  And it turns out Tim was right:</p>
<p>I just knew.</p>

<p>The 3D rendering is based on the quaternions and projections  discussed in
my <a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/11/24/simple-3d-visualization-in-matplotlib/">previous post</a>,
and many of the key bindings discussed there are used here.
The additional component is the turning of each face.  This is actually
fairly simple to accomplish using the tools discussed above.</p>

<p>For example, the right face is perpendicular to the x-axis in the cube-frame.
Thus to turn it, you only need to manipulate polygons with x-coordinate
between 1/3 and 1 inclusive (the cube has side-length 2 and is centered on
the origin).  The correct faces are found quickly using
numpy&#8217;s <code>where</code> statement, and a quaternion rotation is applied only to
these faces.  Easy!</p>

<p>The code and interface still needs some work, and I&#8217;m hoping to add more
features as I have time.  After spending my long weekend working on this,
I have some real work to catch-up on&#8230;</p>

<p><em>Update: I&#8217;ve heard from some folks that the key and mouse bindings don&#8217;t
work on some operating systems or backends.  If you experience
system-dependent bugs and have any insight into the problem, I&#8217;d appreciate
help working out what&#8217;s happening!</em></p>

<p>Matplotlib is a powerful framework, but its 3D capabilities still have
a lot of room to grow. The <a href="http://matplotlib.org/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/index.html">mplot3d</a>
toolkit allows for several kinds of 3D plotting, but the ability to create
and rotate solid 3D objects is hindered by the inflexibility of the <code>zorder</code> attribute:
because it is not updated when the view is rotated, things in the &#8220;back&#8221; will cover
things in the &#8220;front&#8221;, obscuring them and leading to very unnatural-looking results.</p>
<p>I decided to see if I could create a simple script that addresses this.  Though it would
be possible to use the built-in <code>mplot3d</code> architecture to take care of rotating and
projecting the points, I decided to do it from scratch for the sake of my own education.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll step through it below: by the end of this post we will have created a 3D viewer in
matplotlib which I think is quite nice.</p>

  Rotations in 3D: Quaternions
</h2>
</div>
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>The first step to creating an interactive 3D object is to decide on a
representation for the orientation of the object.  <code>mplot3d</code> uses
azimuthal and elevation angles: these are the familiar $\theta$ and $\phi$
of spherical coordinate systems.  While this is a common system, it has the 
disadvantage that things get a little funky near the poles.</p>
<p>Another common framework for mathematical representation of solid-body rotations
is a rotation matrix.  This is nice because multiple rotations can be 
composed quickly, but extracting axis and angle information can require
matrix decompositions that are relatively expensive.</p>
<p>Finally, perhaps the best option is the use of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion">quaternions</a>,
four-dimensional generalizations of complex numbers which can be used to compactly
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation">represent 3D rotations</a>.
A friend who works in the video game industry (in particular the <em>Halo</em> series)
told me that quaternions are what the industry generally prefers in many situations:
they are compact, fast to compose, and very powerful.
On top of that, they&#8217;re generally cool enough that I wanted
an excuse to play around with them a bit.</p>
<p>There have been a few attempts to include quaternions natively in the scipy universe, but
none have stuck.  It&#8217;s a shame, because it would be a very useful feature. In particular,
In particular, I&#8217;d love to see something happen with the quaternion dtype, discussed
<a href="http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2011-July/057675.html">here</a>
on the numpy-dev email list. It looks promising, but has not yet been included in numpy.</p>
<p>With the lack of available implementations, I decided to write a basic quaternion class
which implements the functionality I need: multiplication of quaternions, and tranformation
to and from axis-angle representation:</p>

<p>The mathematics of quaternions (and the use of unit quaternions to represent rotations) is fascinating in itself, but the details beyond this simple implementation are too much for this short post.  I&#8217;d suggest

<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>Let&#8217;s use these quaternions to draw a cube in matplotlib.</p>
<p>A cube is made of six faces, each rotated from the other in multiples of ninety degrees.
With this in mind, we&#8217;ll define a fiducial face, and six rotators which will put the
face in place.</p>
<p>One we have these, we can concatenate a viewing angle to all six, project the results,
and display them as polygons on an axes.  An important piece here is to get the <code>zorder</code>
attribute correct, so that faces in the back do not cover faces in the front.  We&#8217;ll use
the z-coordinate from the projection to do this correctly.</p>
<p>For later use, we&#8217;ll do this all within a class derived from <code>plt.Axes</code>, and make it
so that the set of polygons can be updated if needed:</p>

  Events and Callbacks
</h2>
</div>
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>Now comes the fun part.  We can add events and callbacks to the axes
which will allow us to manipulate the projection by clicking and
dragging on the figure.</p>
<p>We need to add callbacks to the axes: we&#8217;ll do this in the construction
of the class using the <code>mpl_connect</code> method of the canvas. There are
several types of callback events that can be hooked:  they can be found
by typing <code>plt.connect?</code> and seeing the doc-string:</p>
</div>
<div class="cell border-box-sizing code_cell vbox">
<div class="input hbox">
<div class="prompt input_prompt">In [5]:</div>
<div class="input_area box-flex1">
<div class="highlight-ipynb"><pre class="ipynb"><span class="n">plt</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect</span><span class="err">?</span>
</pre></div>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>The available options are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'button_press_event'</code></li>
<li><code>'button_release_event'</code></li>
<li><code>'draw_event'</code></li>
<li><code>'key_press_event'</code></li>
<li><code>'key_release_event'</code></li>
<li><code>'motion_notify_event'</code></li>
<li><code>'pick_event'</code></li>
<li><code>'resize_event'</code></li>
<li><code>'scroll_event'</code></li>
<li><code>'figure_enter_event'</code></li>
<li><code>'figure_leave_event'</code></li>
<li><code>'axes_enter_event'</code></li>
<li><code>'axes_leave_event'</code></li>
<li><code>'close_event'</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these can be connected to a function that performs some operation
when those events happen.  Below, we&#8217;ll use the button events, the motion
event, and the key press event to create an interactive 3D plot.
To be as concise as possible, we&#8217;ll derive from the class we created above:</p>

<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>If you&#8217;re anything like me, your mind is probably spinning with all the
possibilities of these tools.  My eventual goal is to make a fully
functional Rubik&#8217;s cube simulator using these sorts of techniques.  It
will take some thinking, but I think it can be done, and it would be a
very cool demonstration of Matplotlib&#8217;s capabilities!
I&#8217;ll be working on this with David Hogg over at the
<a href="https://github.com/jakevdp/MagicCube">Magic Cube github repository</a>:
much of the simple script
shown above was adapted from code I first wrote there.</p>
<p>The possibilities are endless, and I hope you have fun with these tools!</p>

<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>The recent <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy">0.11 release</a> of scipy includes several new features,
one of which is the <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.csgraph.html">sparse graph submodule</a>
which I contributed, with help from other developers.  I&#8217;m pretty excited about this: there are some
classic algorithms implemented, and it will open up whole new realms of computational possibilities in Python.</p>
<p>Before we start, I should say: this post is based on a <a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/1346/lightning-talks-wednesday">lightning talk</a> I gave
at Scipy 2012, and some of the material below comes from a <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/csgraph.html">tutorial</a>
I wrote for the scipy documentation.</p>
<p>First: what exactly is a sparse graph?  Well, a graph is just a collection of nodes, which have links between them.
<a href="http://networkx.lanl.gov/">NetworkX</a> has some good examples and diagrams.  Graphs can represent nearly anything:
social network connections, where each node is a person and is connected to acquaintences;
images, where each node is a pixel and is connected to neighboring pixels; points in a high-dimensional
distribution, where each node is connected to its nearest neighbors; and practically anything else you can
imagine.</p>
<p>One very efficient way to represent graph data is in a sparse matrix: let&#8217;s call it <code>G</code>.  The matrix <code>G</code> is of size <code>N x N</code>,
and <code>G[i, j]</code> gives the value of the connection between node <code>i</code> and node <code>j</code>.  A sparse graph contains
mostly zeros: that is, most nodes have only a few connections.  This property turns out to be true in most cases of
interest.</p>
<p>The creation of the sparse graph submodule was motivated by several algorithms used in scikit-learn, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Isomap: a manifold learning algorithm which requires finding the shortest paths in a graph</li>
<li>Hierarchical clustering: a clustering algorithm based on a minimum spanning tree</li>
<li>Spectral Decomposition: a projection algorithm based on sparse graph laplacians</li>
</ul>
<p>And many more.</p>

<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at the package, and some of the algorithms available.
Remember, this requires at least Scipy version 0.11, which was
released in September 2012.</p>

<p>Lots of good stuff there!  In order to show the utility of these routines, I&#8217;d like to introduce
an example of a problem that can be quite interesting: word ladders.</p>

  Example: Word Ladders
</h2>
</div>
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_ladder">Word ladders</a> are a game invented by Lewis Carroll, in which words are linked
by changing a single letter at each step.  For example:</p>
<pre class="ipynb"><code>APE -&gt; APT -&gt; AIT -&gt; BIT -&gt; BIG -&gt; BAG -&gt; MAG -&gt; MAN
</code></pre>
<p>Here we have gone from &#8220;APE&#8221; to &#8220;MAN&#8221; in seven steps, changing one
letter each time.  The question is, can
we find a shorter path between these words using the same rules?
As we&#8217;ll see below, this problem is naturally expressed as a
sparse graph problem.  The nodes will correspond to individual words,
and we&#8217;ll create connections
between words that differ by at most one letter.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s some interesting structure in this graph!  The blocks along the diagonal
indicate groups of words which are closely related: for instance, &#8220;cog&#8221;, &#8220;con&#8221;, &#8220;coo&#8221;, &#8220;cot&#8221;, &#8220;cow&#8221;, 
etc. are all near each other in alphabetical order, and share many links: this creates a dark
blob on the diagonal.  We can zoom in to see this:</p>

  Finding the Shortest Path: Dijkstra&#8217;s Algorithm

<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>Now let&#8217;s return to our problem: finding the shortest path from &#8220;APE&#8221; to &#8220;MAN&#8221;.
This is now a graph optimization problem, in which we hope to find the shortest
path from one node to another along the graph.  A well-known algorithm to
accomplish this task is Dyjkstra&#8217;s algorithm, which is based on <a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/09/12/dynamic-programming-in-python/">Dynamic Programming</a>
principles.  Dijkstra&#8217;s algorithm is built into the new <code>csgraph</code> package, and can be used as
follows.</p>

<p>Another question we can ask is this: out of all the shortest paths between any two
nodes, what is the longest?  That is, which connected words are maximally separated
in our linguistic space?  To find out, we can use the distances matrix returned by
the algorithm.</p>
<p>If any words have no path between them, the algorithm returns infinity.  We don&#8217;t care about
the infinities here, so we&#8217;ll mask them out and ask what the longest distance is:</p>

<p>It just doesn&#8217;t have the same effect.  Matplotlib is great for scientific plots, but sometimes you don&#8217;t want to be so precise.</p>
<p>This subject has recently come up on the matplotlib mailing list, and started some interesting discussions.
As near as I can tell, this started with a thread on a
<a href="http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/questions/11350/xkcd-style-graphs">mathematica list</a>
which prompted a thread on the <a href="http://matplotlib.1069221.n5.nabble.com/XKCD-style-graphs-td39226.html">matplotlib list</a>
wondering if the same could be done in matplotlib.</p>
<p>Damon McDougall offered a quick
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/matplotlib-users@lists.sourceforge.net/msg25499.html">solution</a>
which was improved by Fernando Perez in <a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/3835181/">this notebook</a>, and
within a few days there was a <a href="https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/1329">matplotlib pull request</a> offering a very general
way to create sketch-style plots in matplotlib.  Only a few days from a cool idea to a
working implementation: this is one of the most incredible aspects of package development on github.</p>
<p>The pull request looks really nice, but will likely not be included in a released version of
matplotlib until at least version 1.3.  In the mean-time, I wanted a way to play around with
these types of plots in a way that is compatible with the current release of matplotlib.  To do that,
I created the following code:</p>
</div>
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<h2 class="ipynb">
  The Code: XKCDify
</h2>
</div>
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>XKCDify will take a matplotlib <code>Axes</code> instance, and modify the plot elements in-place to make
them look hand-drawn.
First off, we&#8217;ll need to make sure we have the Humor Sans font.
It can be downloaded using the command below.</p>
<p>Next we&#8217;ll create a function <code>xkcd_line</code> to add jitter to lines.  We want this to be very general, so
we&#8217;ll normalize the size of the lines, and use a low-pass filter to add correlated noise, perpendicular
to the direction of the line.  There are a few parameters for this filter that can be tweaked to
customize the appearance of the jitter.</p>
<p>Finally, we&#8217;ll create a function which accepts a matplotlib axis, and calls <code>xkcd_line</code> on
all lines in the axis.  Additionally, we&#8217;ll switch the font of all text in the axes, and add
some background lines for a nice effect where lines cross.  We&#8217;ll also draw axes, and move the
axes labels and titles to the appropriate location.</p>

<p>Pretty good for a couple hours&#8217;s work!</p>
<p>I think the possibilities here are pretty limitless: this is going to be a hugely
useful and popular feature in matplotlib, especially when the sketch artist PR is mature
and part of the main package.  I imagine using this style of plot for schematic figures
in presentations where the normal crisp matplotlib lines look a bit too &#8220;scientific&#8221;.
I&#8217;m giving a few talks at the end of the month&#8230; maybe I&#8217;ll even use some of
this code there.</p>
<p>This post was written entirely in an IPython Notebook: the notebook file is available for
download <a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/downloads/notebooks/XKCD_plots.ipynb">here</a>.
For more information on blogging with notebooks in octopress, see my
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/10/04/blogging-with-ipython/">previous post</a>

<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>A few weeks ago, Fernando Perez, the creator of IPython, wrote a <a href="http://blog.fperez.org/2012/09/blogging-with-ipython-notebook.html">post</a> about blogging with IPython notebooks.  I decided to take a stab at making this work in Octopress.</p>
<p>I started by following Fernando&#8217;s outline:  I first went to <a href="http://github.com/ipython/nbconvert">http://github.com/ipython/nbconvert</a> and obtained the current version of the notebook converter.  Running <code>nbconvert.py -f blogger-html filename.ipynb</code> produces a separate html and header file with the notebook content.  I inserted the stylesheet info into my header (in octopress, the default location is <code>source/_includes/custom/head.html</code>) and copied the html directly into my post.</p>
<p>I immediately encountered a problem.  <code>nbconvert</code> uses global CSS classes and style markups, and some of these (notably the &#8220;hightlight&#8221; class and the <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> tag formatting) conflict with styles defined in my octopress theme.  The result was that every post in my blog ended up looking like an ugly hybrid of octopress and an ipython notebook.  Not very nice.</p>
<p>So I did some surgery.  Admittedly, this is a terrible hack, but the following code takes the files output by nbconvert, slices them up, and creates a specific set of CSS classes for the notebook markup, such that there&#8217;s no longer a conflict with the native octopress styles
(you can download this script <a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/downloads/code/convert_notebook.py">here</a>):</p>

<p>This code should be run with two arguments: first the file to be converted, then the path to <code>nbconvert.py</code>.  Like the native <code>nbconvert.py</code> this produces a separate file of header code (which is inserted once into the  master blog header) and body code which can be copied verbatim into the post.</p>

<p>As we see, it renders nicely.</p>

<p>You can do pretty much anything else a notebook does as well.  The IPython team did the hard part.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="ipynb">
  Where to go from here?
</h2>
</div>
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>There&#8217;s clearly a cleaner way to do this.  If the IPython team would be open to the idea, I think their HTML stylesheets should be modified so that notebooks can be embedded within any CSS framework with as few conflicts as possible.  This means getting rid of all top-level formatting in the style-sheets, and removing potentially common class names like &#8220;highlight&#8221;.  Once this is done, <code>nbconvert.py</code> could output this directly, obviating the need for my unforgivable hack shown above.</p>
<p>Second, I&#8217;d love to build notebook support directly into octopress.  If <code>nbconvert.py</code> is available on the user&#8217;s system, it could be called directly from the Ruby script that generates Octopress HTML.  I have about as much experience with Ruby as I do with Swahili (read: None) so this would take some work for me.  I&#8217;d be happy to pass the baton to any Octopress gurus out there&#8230;</p>
<p>Either of those options will smooth out the notebook/blogging combo considerably, and give me the potential to prognosticate Python in perpetuum.
By the way, the notebook used to generate this page can be downloaded <a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/downloads/notebooks/nb_in_octopress.ipynb">here</a>.  Happy coding!</p>

    <id>http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/09/26/optical-illusions-in-matplotlib</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A while ago I posted some information on the new matplotlib animation
package (see my tutorial
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial">here</a> and
a followup post <a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/09/05/quantum-python">here</a>).  In them, I show
how easy it is to  use matplotlib to create simple animations.</p>

<p>This morning I came across this cool optical illusion on
<a href="http://gizmodo.com/5945194/this-optical-trick-is-annoying-the-hell-out-of-me">gizmodo</a></p>

<p><a href="http://gizmodo.com/5945194/this-optical-trick-is-annoying-the-hell-out-of-me"><img src="http://jakevdp.github.com/images/original_illusion.gif"></a></p>

<p>It intrigued me, so I decided to see if I could create it using matplotlib.
Using my previous template and a bit of geometry, I was able to finish it
before breakfast!  Here&#8217;s the code:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, for part of a textbook I&#8217;m helping to write,
I spent some time reading and researching the history of Python as
a scientific computing tool.  I had heard bits and pieces of this in the past,
but it was fascinating to put it all together and learn about how all the
individual contributions that have made Python what it is today.
All of this got me thinking: for most of us, Python was a replacement for
something: IDL, MatLab, Java, Mathematica, Perl&#8230; you name it.
But what will replace Python?
Ten years down the road, what language will people be espousing in
blogs with awkwardly-alliterated titles?  As I thought it through, I
became more and more convinced that, at least in the scientific computing
world, Python is here to stay.</p>

<p>Now I’m not simply talking about inertia.  Javascript has inertia, and that&#8217;s
a main reason that web admins still begrudgingly use it.  But Python is
different.  Yes, it&#8217;s everywhere, and yes, something so ubiquitous is
hard to shake.  But look at the 1970s: punch card programming was
everywhere, and now it&#8217;s nothing but a footnote. Inertia can be overcome
with time.  But I think Python’s hold is much deeper than that: I think it
will remain relevant long into the future.  Here’s why:</p>

<h2>GitHub</h2>

<p>The first reason Python will be around for a while is
<a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.  GitHub has done wonders both for Python
and for the broader open source community.
It has replaced the clunky Trac system of
submitting static patches to projects, and removed the contribution barrier
for the core scientific python projects.  Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib were
all moved to GitHub in late 2010, and the results have been impressive.
I did some quick data mining of the commit logs on GitHub to learn
about the rate of new author contributions to core python projects with
time, and this is what I found:</p>

<p><img src="http://jakevdp.github.com/figures/author_count.png" width="600" title="[Cumulative number of contributors for python packages]" ></p>

<p>See it? The late 2010 transition to GitHub is extremely apparent,
and this reflects the first reason that NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib,
and Python will remain relevant far into the future.
Python not only has an astoundingly large user-base; thanks to GitHub,
it has an astoundingly large and ever-increasing <em>developer</em> base.
And that means Python is well-poised to evolve as the needs of users change.</p>

<h2>Julia</h2>

<p>The second reason Python will be around for a while is
<a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a>.  This statement may strike some as strange:
Julia is a
language which aims to improve on many of Python’s weaknesses.
It uses JIT compilation and efficient built-in array
support to beat Python on nearly every benchmark.  It seems a likely
candidate to <em>replace</em> Python, not a support for my assertion that Python will
remain relevant. But this is the thing: Python’s strength lies in community,
and that community is incredibly difficult to replicate.</p>

<p>A recent
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/julia-dev/YftOOEfcwrk">thread</a>
on the julia-dev list highlights what I’m talking about:
in it, Dag Seljebotn, a core developer of Cython, contrasts the
strengths of Python (large user- and developer-base, large collection of
libraries) with the strengths of Julia (state-of-the-art performance,
JIT compilation).  He
proposes that the two languages should work together, each drawing from the
strengths of the other.  The response from the Julia community was incredibly
positive.</p>

<p>The Julia developers know that Julia can’t succeed as a scientific
computing platform without building an active community, and currently the
best way to do that is to work hand-in-hand with Python.  After this thread
on julia-dev, the Julia  developers were invited to give
<a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/1204/julia-a-fast-dynamic-language-for-technical-comp">a talk</a>
at the Scipy2012 conference,
and I think many would say that some good bridges were built.
I&#8217;m extremely excited about the prospects of Julia as a scientific computing
platform, but it will only succeed if it can embrace Python, and if Python
can embrace it.</p>

<h2>The next Travis Oliphant</h2>

<p>The third reason Python will be around for a while is this: <em>there will be
another Travis Oliphant</em>.  What do I mean by this?  Well, if you go back
ten years or so, the Python scientific community was looking a bit weak.
Numeric was a
well-established array interface, and the beginnings of SciPy were built
upon it.  But Numeric was clunky, so some folks got together and built
Numarray.  Numarray fixed some of the problems, but had its own weaknesses.
The biggest problem, though, was that it split the community:
when the core of your platform has divided allegiances, neither side wins.
Travis realized this, and against the advice of many, audaciously set out
on a quest to unify the two.  The result was NumPy, which is now the
unrivaled basis for nearly all scientific tools in Python.</p>

<p>Python faces a similar crisis today: it is split in the area of
High-performance and parallel computing.  There is an alphabet soup of
packages which aim to address this:
Cython, PyPy, Theano, Numba, Numexpr, and more.  But
here’s the thing: someone <em>will</em> come along who has the audacity to strike
out and unify them.  I love this recent tweet by Dave Warde-Farley:</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/dwf/status/246756226367643650"><img src="http://jakevdp.github.com/images/dwf_tweet.png" width="400" title="[Cumulative number of contributors for python packages]" ></a></p>

<p>Somebody is going to do this: somebody will be the next Travis Oliphant
and create NumTron to re-unite the community.
Maybe Dave will be the next Travis Oliphant: he&#8217;s done some great work on
<a href="http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/">Theano</a>.
But then again, the merging of Python and LLVM in Travis&#8217;
<a href="http://numba.pydata.org/">Numba</a> project is
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/24/numba-vs-cython/">pretty exciting</a>:
maybe Travis Oliphant will be the next Travis Oliphant &#8211;
he’s done it before, after all.  Or perhaps it will be someone
we’ve never heard of, who as we speak is brewing a new idea in
an unwatched GitHub repository. Time will tell,
but I’m confident that it will happen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Maybe I’ve convinced you, maybe I haven’t.  But I’m going to continue using
Python, and I predict you will too.  We&#8217;ll see what the future holds for
scientific computing, but in my mind, Python remains a pretty solid bet.</p>

<p><em>Finally, a brief post-script on the history of Python:
some of the most interesting sources I found were
<a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/pythonP.html">this interview</a> with Guido Van Rossum,
the official <a href="http://www.scipy.org/History_of_SciPy">Scipy history page</a>, the
<a href="http://pyvideo.org/video/1192/matplotlib-lessons-from-middle-age-or-how-you">Scipy2012 talk</a>
John Hunter gave this summer shortly before his sudden passing,
and the <a href="http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/numpy-discussion/2012-February/060640.html">numpy-discussion post</a>
John referenced in his talk.  If you use Python regularly and have some
time, I’d highly recommend browsing these: it’s incredible to see
how the unwavering vision of folks throughout the years has led to what we
have today: an unmatched open-source environment for scientific computing.</em></p>

    <id>http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/09/12/dynamic-programming-in-python</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Of all the programming styles I have learned,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a>
is perhaps the most beautiful.  It can take problems that, at first glance,
look ugly and intractable, and solve the problem with clean, concise code.
Where a simplistic algorithm might accomplish something by brute force,
dynamic programming steps back, breaks the task into a smaller set of
sequential parts, and then proceeds in the most efficient way possible.</p>

<h3>Bayesian Blocks</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ll go through an example here where the ideas of dynamic programming
are vital to some very cool data analysis resuts.
This post draws heavily from a recent
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012arXiv1207.5578S">paper</a> by Jeff Scargle
and collaborators (this is the Scargle of <em>Lomb-Scargle Periodogram</em>
fame), as well as some conversations I had with Jeff at
<a href="http://www.astro.caltech.edu/ai12/">Astroinformatics 2012</a>.
The paper discusses
a framework called <em>Bayesian Blocks</em>, which is essentially a method of
creating histograms with bin sizes that adapt to the data (there&#8217;s a bit
more to it than that: here we&#8217;ll focus on histograms for simplicity).</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>To motivate this, let&#8217;s take a look at the histogram of some sampled data.
We&#8217;ll create a complicated set of random data in the following way:</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now what does this distribution look like?  We can plot a histogram to find
out:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><img src="http://jakevdp.github.com/figures/bayesblocks1.png" title="[Simple Histogram of our Distribution]" ></p>

<p>Not too informative.  The default bins in <code>matplotlib</code> are too wide for this
dataset.  We might be able to do better by increasing the number of bins:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">pl</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">hist</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">bins</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">normed</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p><img src="http://jakevdp.github.com/figures/bayesblocks2.png" title="[More Detailed Histogram of our Distribution]" ></p>

<p>This is better.  But having to choose the bin width each time we plot a
distribution is not only tiresome, it may lead to missing some important
information in our data.  In a perfect world, we&#8217;d like for
the bin width to be learned in an automated fashion, based on the
properties of the data itself.
There have been many rules-of-thumb proposed for this task
(look up <em>Scott&#8217;s Rule</em>, <em>Knuth&#8217;s Rule</em>, the <em>Freedman-Diaconis Rule</em>,
and others in your favorite statistics text).
But all these rules of thumb share a disadvantage: they make the assumption
that all the bins are the same size.  This is not necessarily optimal.  But
can we do better?</p>

<p>Scargle and collaborators showed that the answer is yes.  This is their insight:
For a set of histogram bins or <em>blocks</em>, each of an arbitrary size,
one can use a Bayesian
likelihood framework to compute a <em>fitness function</em> which only depends on
two numbers: the width of each block, and the number of points in each block.
The edges between these blocks (the <em>change-points</em>) can be varied, and
the overall block configuration with the maximum fitness is quantitatively
the best binning.</p>

<p>Simple, right?</p>

<p>Well, no.  The problem is, as the number of points N grows large, the number
of possible configurations grows as 2<sup>N</sup> .  For N=300 points, there are already
more possible configurations than the number of subatomic particles in the
observable universe!  Clearly an exhaustive search will fail in cases of
interest.  This is where <em>dynamic programming</em> comes to the rescue.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Programming</h3>

<p>Dynamic programming is very similar to mathematical proof by induction. By
way of example, consider the formula</p>

<p>$1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$.</p>

<p>How could you prove that this is true for all positive integers $n$?
An inductive proof of this formula proceeds in the following fashion:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Base Case</strong>: We can easily show that the formula holds for $n = 1$.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Inductive Step</strong>: For some value $k$, assume that
$1 + 2 + \cdots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}$ holds.
Adding $(k + 1)$ to each side and rearranging the result yields
$1 + 2 + \cdots + k + (k + 1) = \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{2}$.  Looking
closely at this, we see that we have shown the following:
if our formula is true for $k$, then it must be true for $k + 1$.</p></li>
<li>By 1 and 2, we can show that the formula is true for any positive integer
$n$, simply by starting at $n=1$ and repeating the inductive step
$n - 1$ times.</li>
</ol>


<p>Dynamic programming proceeds in much the same vein.  In our Bayesian Blocks
example, we can easily find the optimal binning for a single point.  By
making use of some mathematical proofs concerning the fitness functions,
we can devise a simple step from the optimal binning for $k$ points to the
optimal binning for $k + 1$ points (the details can be found in the
appendices of the
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012arXiv1207.5578S">Scargle paper</a>).
In this way, Scargle and collaborators showed that the 2<sup>N</sup> possible states
can be explored in N<sup>2</sup> time.</p>

<h3>The Algorithm</h3>

<p>The resulting algorithm is deceptively simple, but it can be proven to converge
to the single best configuration among the 2<sup>N</sup> possibilities.  Below is the
basic code written in python.  Note that there are a few details that are
missing from this version (e.g. priors on the number of bins, other forms
of fitness functions, etc.) but this gets the basic job done:</p>

<p>The details of the step from $K$ to $K + 1$ may be a bit confusing from this
implementation: it boils down to the fact that Scargle <em>et al.</em> were able to
show that given an optimal configuration of $K$ points, the $(K + 1)$<sup>th</sup>
configuration is limited to one of $K$ possibilities.</p>

<p>The function as written above takes a sequence of points, and returns the
edges of the optimal bins.  We&#8217;ll visualize the result on top of the histogram
we saw earlier:</p>

<p>The adaptive-width bins lead to a very clean representation of the important
features in the data.  More importantly, these bins are quantifiably optimal,
and their properties can be used to make quantitative statistical
statements about the nature of the data.  This type of procedure has proven
very useful in analysis of time-series data in Astronomy.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ve just scratched the surface of Bayesian Blocks and Dynamic Programming.
Some of the more interesting details of this algorithm require much more
depth: the appendicies of the
<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012arXiv1207.5578S">Scargle paper</a>
provide these details.  Dynamic Programming ideas have been shown to be
useful in many optimization problems.  One other example I&#8217;ve worked with
extensively is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra&#8217;s Algorithm</a>
for computing the shortest paths on a connected graph.  This is available in
the <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/csgraph.html">scipy.sparse.csgraph</a>
submodule, which is included in the most recent release of scipy.</p>

<p>The above python implementation of Bayesian Blocks
is an extremely basic form of the algorithm: I plan to include some
more sophisticated options in the python package I&#8217;m currently
working on, called <em>astroML: Machine Learning for Astrophysics</em>.
I&#8217;ll release version 0.1 of astroML at the end of October 2012,
in time to present it at <a href="http://c3.nasa.gov/dashlink/events/1/">CIDU 2012</a>.
If you&#8217;re interested, I&#8217;ll have updates here on the blog, as well as on
my <a href="http://twitter.com/jakevdp">twitter feed</a>.</p>

<p><em>Update: astroML version 0.1 has been released: see the web site
<a href="http://astroML.github.com">here</a>.  It includes a full-featured Bayesian
blocks implementation with histogram tools, which you can read about
<a href="http://astroml.github.com/user_guide/density_estimation.html#bayesian-blocks-histograms-the-right-way">here</a>.</em></p>

    <updated>2012-09-05T20:12:00-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/09/05/quantum-python</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial/">previous post</a>
I explored the new animation capabilities of the latest
<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net">matplotlib</a> release.
It got me wondering whether it would be possible to simulate more complicated
physical systems in real time in python.  Quantum Mechanics was the first
thing that came to mind.  It turns out that by mixing a bit of Physics
knowledge with a bit of computing knowledge, it&#8217;s quite straightforward
to simulate and animate a simple quantum mechanical system with python.</p>

<h2>The Schrodinger Equation</h2>

<p>The dynamics of a one-dimensional quantum system are governed by the
time-dependent Schrodinger equation:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
i\hbar\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}
  = \frac{-\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + V \psi
\]</div>




<!-- more -->


<p>The <em>wave function</em> $\psi$ is a function of both position $x$ and time $t$,
and is the fundamental description of the realm of the very small.
Imagine we are following the motion of a single particle in one
dimension.  This wave function represents a probability of measuring
the particle at a position $x$ at a time $t$. Quantum mechanics tells us that
(contrary to our familiar classical reasoning) this probability is not
a limitation of our knowledge of the system, but a reflection of an
unavoidable uncertainty about the position and time of events in the realm
of the very small.</p>

<p>Still, this equation is a bit opaque, but to visualize the results we&#8217;ll need
to solve this numerically.  We&#8217;ll approach this using the split-step Fourier
method.</p>

<h2>The Split-step Fourier Method</h2>

<p>A standard way to numerically solve certain differential equations is
through the use of the Fourier transform.  We&#8217;ll use a Fourier convention
of the following form:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\widetilde{\psi}(k, t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \psi(x, t) e^{-ikx} dx
\]</div>


<p>Under this convention, the associated inverse Fourier Transform is given by:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\psi(x, t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
  \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \widetilde{\psi}(k, t) e^{ikx} dk
\]</div>


<p>Substituting this into the Schrodinger equation and simplifying gives the
Fourier-space form of the Schrodinger equation:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
i\hbar\frac{\partial \widetilde{\psi}}{\partial t}
  = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} \widetilde{\psi}
  + V(i\frac{\partial}{\partial k})\widetilde{\psi}
\]</div>


<p>The two versions of the Schrodinger equation contain an interesting symmetry:
the time step in each case depends on a straightforward multiplication of
the wave function $\psi$, as well as a more complicated term involving
derivatives with respect to $x$ or $k$.  The key observation is that while
the equation is difficult to evaluate fully within one of the forms, each
basis offers a straightforward calculation of one of the two contributions.
This suggests an efficient strategy to numerically solve the Schrodinger
Equation.</p>

<p>First we solve the straightforward part of the $x$-space Schrodinger
equation:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
i\hbar\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}
  = V(x) \psi
\]</div>


<p>For a small time step $\Delta t$, this has a solution of the form</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\psi(x, t + \Delta t) = \psi(x, t) e^{-i V(x) \Delta t / \hbar}
\]</div>


<p>Second, we solve the straightforward part of the $k$-space Schrodinger
equation:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
i\hbar\frac{\partial \widetilde{\psi}}{\partial t}
  = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m} \widetilde{\psi}
\]</div>


<p>For a small time step $\Delta t$, this has a solution of the form</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\widetilde{\psi}(k, t + \Delta t)
    = \widetilde{\psi}(k, t) e^{-i \hbar k^2 \Delta t / 2m}
\]</div>


<h2>Numerical Considerations</h2>

<p>Solving this system numerically will require repeated computations of the
Fourier transform of $\psi(x, t)$ and the inverse Fourier transform of
$\widetilde{\psi}(k, t)$.  The best-known algorithm for computation of
numerical Fourier transforms is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which
is <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/fftpack.html">available in scipy</a>
and efficiently computes the following form of the
discrete Fourier transform:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
  \widetilde{F}_m = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} F_n e^{-2\pi i n m / N}
\]</div>


<p>and its inverse</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
  F_n = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} \widetilde{F}_m e^{2\pi i n m / N}
\]</div>


<p>We need to know how these relate to the continuous Fourier transforms defined
and used above.  Let&#8217;s take the example of the forward transform.  Assume that
the infinite integral is well-approximated by the finite integral from
$a$ to $b$, so that we can write</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\widetilde{\psi}(k, t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
   \int_a^b \psi(x, t) e^{-ikx} dx
\]</div>


<p>This approximation ends up being equivalent to assuming that the potential
$V(x) \to \infty$ at $x \le a$ and $x \ge b$.  We&#8217;ll now approximate this
integral as a Riemann sum of $N$ terms, and define $\Delta x = (b - a) / N$,
and $x_n = a + n\Delta x$:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\widetilde{\psi}(k, t) \simeq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
   \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \psi(x_n, t) e^{-ikx_n} \Delta x
\]</div>


<p>This is starting to look like the discrete Fourier transform!  To bring it
even closer, let&#8217;s define $k_m = k_0 + m\Delta k$, with
$\Delta k = 2\pi / (N\Delta x)$.  Then our approximation becomes</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\widetilde{\psi}(k_m, t) \simeq \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
   \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \psi(x_n, t) e^{-ik_m x_n} \Delta x
\]</div>


<p>(Note that just as we have limited the range of $x$ above, we have here limited
the range of $k$ as well.  This means that high-frequency components of the
signal will be lost in our approximation.  The Nyquist sampling theorem tells
us that this is an unavoidable consequence of choosing discrete steps in
space, and it can be shown that the spacing we chose above exactly satisfies
the Nyquist limit if we choose $k_0 = - \pi / \Delta x$).</p>

<p>Plugging our expressions for $x_n$ and $k_m$ into the Fourier
approximation and rearranging, we find the following:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\left[\widetilde{\psi}(k_m, t) e^{i m x_0 \Delta k}\right]
   \simeq \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} 
   \left[ \frac{\Delta x}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
   \psi(x_n, t) e^{-ik_0 x_n} \right]
   e^{-2\pi i m n / N}
\]</div>


<p>Similar arguments from the inverse Fourier transform yield:</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
\left[\frac{\Delta x}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \psi(x_n, t) e^{-i k_0 x_n}\right]
   \simeq \frac{1}{N} \sum_{m=0}^{N-1} 
   \left[\widetilde{\psi}(k_m, t) e^{-i m x_0 \Delta k} \right]
   e^{2\pi i m n / N}
\]</div>


<p>Comparing these to the discrete Fourier transforms above, we find that the
<em>continuous</em> Fourier pair</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
   \psi(x, t) \Longleftrightarrow \widetilde{\psi}(k, t)
\]</div>


<p>corresponds to the <em>discrete</em> Fourier pair</p>

<div markdown="0">\[
   \frac{\Delta x}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \psi(x_n, t) e^{-i k_0 x_n}
   \Longleftrightarrow
   \widetilde{\psi}(k_m, t) e^{-i m x_0 \Delta k}
\]</div>


<p>subject to the approximations mentioned above.  This allows a fast numerical
evaluation of the Schrodinger equation.</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together: the Algorithm</h2>

<p>We now put this all together using the following algorithm</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Choose $a$, $b$, $N$, and $k_0$ as above, sufficient to represent the
initial state of your wave function $\psi(x)$. (<strong>Warning:</strong> this is perhaps
the hardest part of the entire solution. If limits in $x$ or $k$ are chosen
which do not suit your problem, then the approximations used above can
destroy the accuracy of the calculation!)  Once these are chosen, then
$\Delta x = (b - a) / N$ and $\Delta k = 2\pi / (b - a)$.  Define
$x_n = a + n \Delta x$ and $k_m = k_0 + m \Delta k$.</p></li>
<li><p>Discretize the wave-functions on this grid.  Let $\psi_n(t) = \psi(x_n, t)$,
$V_n = V(x_n)$, and $\widetilde{\psi}_m = \widetilde{\psi}(k_m, t)$.</p></li>
<li><p>To progress the system by a time-step $\Delta t$, perform the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Compute a half-step in $x$:
$\psi_n \longleftarrow \psi_n
 \exp[-i (\Delta t / 2) (V_n / \hbar)]$</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate $\widetilde{\psi}_m$ from $\psi_n$ using the FFT.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute a full-step in $k$:
$\widetilde{\psi}_m \longleftarrow \widetilde{\psi}_m
\exp[-i \hbar (k \cdot k) \Delta t / (2 m)]$</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate $\psi_n$ from $\widetilde{\psi}_m$ using the inverse FFT.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute a second half-step in $x$:
$\psi_n \longleftarrow \psi_n
 \exp[-i (\Delta t / 2)(V_n / \hbar)]$</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Repeat step 3 until the desired time is reached.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Note that we have split the $x$-space time-step into two half-steps: this
turns out to lead to a more stable numerical solution than performing
the step all at once. Those familiar with numerical integration
algorithms may recognize this as an example of the
well-known leap-frog integration technique.</p>

<p>To test this out, I&#8217;ve written a python code which sets up a particle in a
box with a potential barrier.  The barrier is high enough that a classical
particle would be unable to penetrate it.  A quantum particle, however, can
&#8220;tunnel&#8221; through, leading to a non-zero probability of finding the particle
on the other side of the partition.  This quantum tunneling effect lies at
the core of technologies as diverse as electron microsopy, semiconding diodes,
and perhaps even the future of low-powered transistors.</p>

<p>The animation of the result is below (for a brief introduction to the animation
capabilities of python, see
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial/">this post</a>).
The top panel shows the position-space wave function, while the bottom panel
shows the momentum-space wave function.</p>

<p><video width='360' height='270' preload='none' controls poster=' /downloads/videos/schrodinger_barrier_frame.png'><source src='http://jakevdp.github.com/downloads/videos/schrodinger_barrier.mp4' type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'/></video></p>

<p>Notice that the height of the potential barrier (denoted by the dashed line in
the bottom panel) is far larger than the energy of the particle.  Still, due
to quantum effects, a small part of the wave function is able to tunnel through
the barrier and reach the other side.</p>

<p>The python code used to generate this animation is included below.  It&#8217;s pretty
long, but I&#8217;ve tried to comment extensively to make the algorithm more clear.
If you&#8217;re so inclined, you might try running the example and adjusting the
potential or the input wave function to see the effect on the dynamics of
the quantum system.</p>

    <id>http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/24/numba-vs-cython</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Often I&#8217;ll tell people that I use python for computational analysis, and they
look at me inquisitively.  &#8220;Isn&#8217;t python pretty slow?&#8221;  They have a point.
Python is an interpreted language, and as such cannot natively perform
many operations as quickly as a compiled language such as C or Fortran.
There is also the issue of the oft-misunderstood and much-maligned
<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock">GIL</a>,
which calls into question python&#8217;s ability to allow true parallel computing.</p>

<p>Many solutions have been proposed: <a href="http://pypy.org/">PyPy</a> is a much faster
version of the core python language;
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/numexpr/">numexpr</a> provides optimized performance
on certain classes of operations from within python;
<a href="http://www.scipy.org/Weave/">weave</a> allows inline inclusion of compiled
C/C++ code;
<a href="http://www.cython.org/">cython</a> provides extra markup that allows python
and/or python-like code to be compiled into C for fast operations.  But
a naysayer might point out: many of these &#8220;python&#8221; solutions in practice
are not really python at all, but clever hacks into Fortran or C.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I personally have no problem with this. I like python because it gives me a nice
work-flow: it has a clean syntax, I don&#8217;t need to spend my time hunting down
memory errors, it&#8217;s quick to try-out code snippets, it&#8217;s easy to wrap legacy
code written in C and Fortran, and I&#8217;m much more productive when writing
python vs writing C or C++.  <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org">Numpy</a>,
<a href="http://www.scipy.org">scipy</a>, and <a href="http://www.scikit-learn.org">scikit-learn</a>
give me optimized routines for most of what I need to do on a daily basis,
and if something more specialized comes up, cython has never failed me.
Nevertheless, the whole setup is a bit clunky:
why can&#8217;t I have the best of both worlds: a beautiful, scripted, dynamically
typed language like python, with the speed of C or Fortran?</p>

<p>In recent years, new languages like <a href="http://golang.org/">go</a> and
<a href="http://julialang.org/">julia</a> have popped up which try to address some of
these issues.  Julia in particular has a number of nice properties (see the
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCp1jUgVRgE">talk</a> from Scipy 2012 for a
good introduction) and uses <a href="http://llvm.org">LLVM</a> to enable just-in-time
(JIT) compilation and achieve some impressive benchmarks.  Julia holds promise,
but I&#8217;m not yet ready to abandon the incredible code-base and user-base
of the python community.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://numba.pydata.org/">numba</a>.  This is an attempt to bring JIT
compilation cleanly to python, using the LLVM framework.  In a
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/08/memoryview-benchmarks/">recent post</a>, one commenter pointed
out numba as an alternative to cython.  I had heard about it before (See
Travis Oliphant&#8217;s scipy 2012 talk
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYi1cymszqY">here</a>) but hadn&#8217;t had the chance
to try it out until now. Installation is a bit involved, but the directions
on the <a href="http://numba.pydata.org/">numba website</a> are pretty good.</p>

<p>To test this out, I decided to run some benchmarks using the
pairwise distance function I&#8217;ve explored before (see posts
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/08/memoryview-benchmarks/">here</a>
and <a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/16/memoryview-benchmarks-2/">here</a>).</p>

<p>This is a three order-of-magnitude speedup, simply by adding a numba
decorator!</p>

<h3>Cython Version</h3>

<p>For completeness, let&#8217;s do the same thing in cython.  Cython
takes a bit more than just some decorators: there are also type specifiers
and other imports required.  Additionally, we&#8217;ll use the <code>sqrt</code> function
from the C math library rather than from numpy.  Here&#8217;s the code:</p>

<h3>The Takeaway</h3>

<p>So numba is 1000 times faster than a pure python implementation, and only
marginally slower than nearly identical cython code.
There are some caveats here: first of all, I have years of experience with
cython, and only an hour&#8217;s experience with numba.  I&#8217;ve used every optimization
I know for the cython version, and just the basic vanilla syntax for numba.
There are likely ways to tweak the numba version to make it even faster,
as indicated in the comments of
<a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/08/memoryview-benchmarks/">this post</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, I should say I&#8217;m very impressed.  Using numba, I added
just a <em>single line</em> to the original python code, and
was able to attain speeds competetive with a highly-optimized (and
significantly less &#8220;pythonic&#8221;)  cython implementation.  Based on this,
I&#8217;m extremely excited to see what numba brings in the future.</p>

<p>All the above code is available as an ipython notebook:

    <id>http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/18/matplotlib-animation-tutorial</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net">Matplotlib</a> version 1.1 added some tools
for creating
<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/animation_api.html">animations</a>
which are really slick.  You can find some good example animations on
the matplotlib
<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/examples/animation/index.html">examples</a>
page.  I thought I&#8217;d share here some of the things I&#8217;ve learned when playing
around with these tools.</p>

<h3>Basic Animation</h3>

<p>The animation tools center around the <code>matplotlib.animation.Animation</code> base
class, which provides a framework around which the animation functionality
is built.  The main interfaces are <code>TimedAnimation</code> and <code>FuncAnimation</code>,
which you can read more about in the
<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/animation_api.html">documentation</a>.
Here I&#8217;ll explore using the <code>FuncAnimation</code> tool, which I have found
to be the most useful.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>First we&#8217;ll use <code>FuncAnimation</code> to do a basic animation of a sine wave moving
across the screen:</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s step through this and see what&#8217;s going on.  After importing required
pieces of <code>numpy</code> and <code>matplotlib</code>, The script sets up the plot:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="n">ax</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">plt</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">axes</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">xlim</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="n">ylim</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">))</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">line</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ax</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">plot</span><span class="p">([],</span> <span class="p">[],</span> <span class="n">lw</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here we create a figure window, create a single axis in the figure, and then
create our line object which will be modified in the animation.  Note that
here we simply plot an empty line: we&#8217;ll add data to the line later.</p>

<p>Next we&#8217;ll create the functions which make the animation happen.  <code>init()</code>
is the function which will be called to create the base frame upon which
the animation takes place.  Here we use just a simple function which sets
the line data to nothing.  It is important that this function return the
line object, because this tells the animator which objects on the plot to
update after each frame:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The next piece is the animation function.  It takes a single parameter, the
frame number <code>i</code>, and draws a sine wave with a shift that depends on <code>i</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">line</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that again here we return a tuple of the plot objects which have been
modified.  This tells the animation framework what parts of the plot should
be animated.</p>

<p>Finally, we create the animation object:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='python'><span class='line'><span class="n">anim</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">animation</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">FuncAnimation</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fig</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">animate</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">init_func</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">init</span><span class="p">,</span>
</span><span class='line'>                               <span class="n">frames</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">100</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">interval</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">blit</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This object needs to persist, so it must be assigned to a variable.  We&#8217;ve
chosen a 100 frame animation with a 20ms delay between frames.  The
<code>blit</code> keyword is an important one: this tells the animation to only re-draw
the pieces of the plot which have changed.  The time saved with <code>blit=True</code>
means that the animations display much more quickly.</p>

<p>We end with an optional save command, and then a show command to show the
result.  Here&#8217;s what the script generates:
<video width='360' height='270' preload='none' controls poster=' /downloads/videos/basic_animation_frame.png'><source src='http://jakevdp.github.com/downloads/videos/basic_animation.mp4' type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'/></video></p>

<p>This framework for generating and saving animations is very powerful and
flexible: if we put some physics into the <code>animate</code> function, the possibilities
are endless.  Below are a couple examples of some physics animations that
I&#8217;ve been playing around with.</p>

<h3>Double Pendulum</h3>

<p>One of the examples provided on the matplotlib
<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/examples/animation/index.html">example page</a>
is an animation of a double pendulum.  This example operates by precomputing
the pendulum position over 10 seconds, and then animating the results.  I
saw this and wondered if python would be fast enough to compute the dynamics
on the fly.  It turns out it is:</p>

<p>Here we&#8217;ve created a class which stores the state of the double pendulum
(encoded in the angle of each arm plus the angular velocity of each arm)
and also provides some functions for computing the dynamics.  The animation
functions are the same as above, but we just have a bit more complicated
update function: it not only changes the position of the points, but also
changes the text to keep track of time and energy (energy should be constant
if our math is correct: it&#8217;s comforting that it is).  The video below
lasts only ten seconds, but by running the script you can watch the
pendulum chaotically oscillate until your laptop runs out of power:</p>

<h3>Particles in a Box</h3>

<p>Another animation I created is the elastic collisions of a group of particles
in a box under the force of gravity.  The collisions are elastic: they conserve
energy and 2D momentum, and the particles bounce realistically off the walls
of the box and fall under the influence of a constant gravitational force:</p>

<p>The math should be familiar to anyone with a physics background, and the
result is pretty mesmerizing.  I coded this up during a flight, and ended
up just sitting and watching it for about ten minutes.</p>

<p><video width='360' height='270' preload='none' controls poster=' /downloads/videos/particle_box_frame.png'><source src='http://jakevdp.github.com/downloads/videos/particle_box.mp4' type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'/></video></p>

<p>This is just the beginning: it might be an interesting exercise to add
other elements, like computation of the temperature and pressure to demonstrate
the ideal gas law, or real-time plotting of the velocity distribution to
watch it approach the expected Maxwellian distribution.  It opens up many
possibilities for virtual physics demos&#8230;</p>

<h3>Summing it up</h3>

<p>The matplotlib animation module is an excellent addition to what was already
an excellent package.  I think I&#8217;ve just scratched the surface of what&#8217;s
possible with these tools&#8230; what cool animation ideas can you come up
with?</p>

<p>Edit: in a <a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/09/05/quantum-python">followup post</a>, I show how
these tools can be used to generate an animation of a simple Quantum
Mechanical system.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/08/memoryview-benchmarks/">previous post</a>, I explored
how cython typed memoryviews can be used to speed up repeated array
operations.  It became clear that typed memoryviews are superior to
the ndarray syntax for slicing, and as fast as raw pointers for single
element access.  In the comments, Mathieu brought up an interesting
question: is the ndarray syntax as good as typed memoryviews if you&#8217;re
not doing slicing?</p>

<p>The answer turns out to be yes, <em>unless</em> the compiler tries to inline your
function.</p>

<h3>Inlined Memoryview</h3>

<p>We&#8217;ll use a slightly simpler benchmark script here for simplicity.  We&#8217;ll
use inlined typed memoryviews for the inner function, and call this function
within an outer loop:</p>

<p>The inner function is called <code>N</code> times.  We&#8217;ve used the &#8220;inline&#8221; keyword here:
it turns out this is optional with common compiler optimizations turned on.
<code>gcc</code> and other compilers are smart enough to figure out that this function
should be inlined, even if the cython code doesn&#8217;t mark it as such.  Timing
the function on one million loops gives us our comparison benchmark:</p>

<pre><code>%timeit loop_1(1E6)
100000 loops, best of 3: 10.1 us per loop
</code></pre>

<p>Just over a millisecond to perform this loop one million times.</p>

<h3>Non-inlined Memoryview</h3>

<p>Because the compilers are generally so smart, we actually need to be a bit
clever to make sure our function is <em>not</em> inlined.  We&#8217;ll do that through
a switch statement in the loop call, which selects between two possible
inner functions.  This may seem a bit contrived, but it could come up
in practice: for example, if we wanted to create a KDTree for nearest neighbor
searches which can use one of several distance metrics within a single tree
framework, we might be tempted to try a solution like this:</p>

<p>By adding the switch function, it means the compiler cannot know at compile
time which of the inner functions will be used in the loop, and they
cannot be inlined.  The timing results are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>%timeit loop_2(1E6)
10 loops, best of 3: 22.9 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>Using a non-inlined function makes things significantly slower in this case!
So, if you&#8217;re repeatedly calling a small function, inlining can be <em>very</em>
important for optimal execution times.</p>

<h3>The Problem with ndarray</h3>

<p>It turns out that beyond slicing, the problem with the ndarray type is that
multi-dimensional arrays require relatively expensive buffer checks whenever
a function is called.  This causes similar code with ndarrays to be
significantly slower:</p>

<p>Compiling this gives the following warning:</p>

<pre><code>warning: Buffer unpacking not optimized away.
</code></pre>

<p>The result of this buffer unpacking in each loop is a much slower execution
time:</p>

<pre><code>%timeit loop_3(1E6)
1 loops, best of 3: 617 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>This is about 30 times slower than the non-inlined version of the memoryview,
and 6000 times slower than the inlined memoryview above!
Is there any way around this?
Well, there are two options: raw pointers, or explicit inlining in the
code (that is, copying and pasting your code).  Both options will have
speeds similar to that of the inlined memoryviews, but each solution
is inconvenient in its own way.</p>

<p>So why wouldn&#8217;t you use memoryviews?  Well, several projects strive to
remain compatible with python 2.4 (one example is scipy) and python 2.4 is
not compatible with cython&#8217;s typed memoryviews.  Other projects seek to
remain compatible with earlier cython versions which don&#8217;t support
the relatively new memoryview syntax.
In these situations, one of the two partial solutions above
probably need to be used.  In practice, I have usually resorted to passing
around raw pointers.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Here are the timings we found above:</p>

<ul>
<li>Inlined memoryviews: 0.1 ms</li>
<li>Non-inlined memoryviews: 22.9 ms</li>
<li>Inlined ndarray: 617 ms</li>
</ul>


<p>So we see yet another reason that typed memoryviews are superior to
the ndarray syntax: they not only have very speedy slicing, but also
play well with the compiler&#8217;s inlining optimization.  Granted, these
time differences will be insignificant if your inlined function does
some non-negligible amount of computation, but there may be situations
where this affects things.</p>

<h3>Back to my problem</h3>

<p>If you recall, I started all of this because I wanted to create a binary tree
that can compute pairwise distances with arbitrary distance metrics.  Where
do these results put me?  Not in a great position, it turns out.  Abstracting
out the distance function so that the same machinery can be used with
different functions will lead to speed penalties from the inability to inline.
C++ libraries accomplish this through compile-time conditionals (i.e. templates)
but cython doesn&#8217;t have this capability.  Duplicating the tree
framework with a new hard-coded (and thus inlinable) distance metric may
be the only option.  That, or wrapping a templated C++ implementation.</p>

    <id>http://jakevdp.github.com/blog/2012/08/08/memoryview-benchmarks</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There was recently a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/cython-users/8uuxjB_wbBQ[1-25]" title="cython-users archive">thread</a>
on cython-users which caught my eye.  It has to do with
<a href="http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/memoryviews.html">memoryviews</a>, a new
way of working with memory buffers in cython.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking recently about how to do fast
and flexible memory buffer access in cython.  I contributed the
<a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.BallTree.html">BallTree</a>
implementation for nearest neighbors searching in
<a href="http://www.scikit-learn.org">scikit-learn</a>, and have been actively thinking
about how to make it faster and more flexible, including adding the ability
to specify distance metrics other than euclidean and minkowski.</p>

<p>In order to accomplish this, I&#8217;d like to have a set of distance metric
functions which take two vectors and compute a distance.  There would
be many functions with similar call signatures which could then be
plugged into a code that would iterate over a set of vectors and
compute the appropriate distances.</p>

<h3>Pure python version</h3>

<p>In pure python, the implementation described above might look something
like this:</p>

<p>This looks promising.  Let&#8217;s create a function based on this which will compute
the pairwise distance between all points in a matrix (this is similar
to <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances.html">pairwise_distances</a> in scikit-learn or
<a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.pdist.html">pdist</a> in scipy).  The simple form of the function might look
like this:</p>

<p>We could exploit symmetry to reduce the number of computations required, but
we&#8217;ll skip that step for now: this simple version of the function will give
us a good benchmark for comparison with alternatives below.  Using the
<code>timeit</code> magic in ipython, we can learn how fast this implementation is:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: import numpy as np

In [2]:from memview_bench_v1 import pairwise

In [3]: X = np.random.random((500, 3))

In [4]: timeit pairwise(X)
1 loops, best of 3: 6.51 s per loop
</code></pre>

<p>It takes nearly seven seconds to compute 250,000 distances.  This is much
too slow.</p>

<h3>Cython Speedup</h3>

<p>Perhaps we can speed this up using cython declarations.  Before typed
memoryviews were added in cython 0.16, the way to quickly index numpy
arrays in cython was through the numpy specific syntax, adding type
information to each array that specifies its data type, its dimension, and
its order:</p>

<p>Notice that we&#8217;re essentially running the same code, except we have added
type identifiers to speed up function calls and loops.  The <code>mode='c'</code>
argument in the <code>np.ndarray</code> type says that the array is contiguous in
memory, and C-ordered.</p>

<p>For reference, this can be compiled in-place by running
<code>python setup.py build_ext --inplace</code> with the following

<p>We&#8217;ll time the resulting function on the same sized array as we did previously:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: import numpy as np

In [2]: from memview_bench_v2 import pairwise

In [3]: X = np.random.random((500, 3))

In [4]: timeit pairwise(X)
1 loops, best of 3: 668 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s a factor of 10 speedup over the pure python version!  It turns out,
though, that we can do better.  In particular, the slicing operation when
we call <code>X[i]</code> and <code>X[j]</code> must generate a new numpy array each time, which
leads to a lot of python overhead in reference counting, etc.  This is the
reason that the cython team introduced typed memoryviews in cython v0.16.</p>

<h3>Typed Memoryviews</h3>

<p>The equivalent of the above code using typed memoryviews looks like this:</p>

<p>The only change is that instead of using the <code>np.ndarray[...]</code> type specifier,
we use the typed memoryview <code>double[:, ::1]</code> specifier.  The <code>::1</code> in the
second position means that we are passing a two-dimensional array, which
is contiguous and C-ordered.  We time the results and see the following:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: import numpy as np

In [2]: from memview_bench_v3 import pairwise

In [3]: X = np.random.random((500, 3))

In [4]: timeit pairwise(X)
10 loops, best of 3: 22 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>This gives another factor of 30 improvement over the previous version, simply
by switching to typed memoryviews rather than the numpy interface.  Still,
our function is creating memoryview objects each time we slice the array.  We
can determine how much overhead this is generating by using raw C pointers
instead.  It is not as clean, but it should be very fast:</p>

<h3>Raw Pointers</h3>

<p>The fundamental benchmark for this sort of operation should be working
directly with the pointers themselves.  While this is not a very &#8220;pythonic&#8221;
way of doing things, it does lead to very fast code, as we will see:</p>

<p>Instead of passing around slices of arrays, we&#8217;ve accessed the raw memory
buffer using C pointer syntax.  This is not as easy to read, and can lead
to <code>glibc</code> errors or segmentation faults if we&#8217;re not careful.  Testing
this implementation, we find that it is extremely fast:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: import numpy as np

In [2]: from memview_bench_v4 import pairwise

In [3]: X = np.random.random((500, 3))

In [4]: timeit pairwise(X)
100 loops, best of 3: 2.47 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>This is another factor of 10 faster than the memoryview benchmark above!
Essentially, what this is telling us is that creating a memoryview slice
takes about 0.02 / 500,000 = 40 nanoseconds on our machine.  This is extremely
fast, but because we&#8217;re performing this operation half a million times, the
cost of the allocations is significant compared to the rest of our
computation.  If our vectors were, say, length 1000, this cost may not be
a significant percentage of the total cost.</p>

<p>So what are we left with?  Do we need to use raw pointers in all circumstances
when working with collections of small vectors?  Perhaps not.</p>

<h3>A Faster Implementation with Memoryviews</h3>

<p>The creation of memoryview slices, though extremely fast, is causing a problem
simply because we&#8217;re creating so many slices.  Here is an alternative which
uses no raw pointers, but matches the speed of raw pointers:</p>

<p>Timing this implementation we find the following:</p>

<pre><code>In [1]: import numpy as np

In [2]: from memview_bench_v5 import pairwise

In [3]: X = np.random.random((500, 3))

In [4]: timeit pairwise(X)
100 loops, best of 3: 2.45 ms per loop
</code></pre>

<p>Just as fast as using raw pointers, but much cleaner and easier to read.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Here are the timing results we&#8217;ve seen above:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Python + numpy</strong>: 6510 ms</li>
<li><strong>Cython + numpy</strong>: 668 ms</li>
<li><strong>Cython + memviews (slicing)</strong>: 22 ms</li>
<li><strong>Cython + raw pointers</strong>: 2.47 ms</li>
<li><strong>Cython + memviews (no slicing)</strong>: 2.45 ms</li>
</ul>


<p>So what have we learned here?  First of all, typed memoryviews are fast.
Blazing fast.  If used correctly, they can be comparable to raw pointers,
but are much cleaner easier to debug.  For example, in the last
version, if we ran into a memory error we could simply turn on bounds-checking
and quickly find the source of the problem.  Slicing with memoryviews is
also fast, but should be used carefully if your operation time on each slice
is compararable to the cost of building the slice.</p>

<p>The moral of the story?  <em>Use typed memoryviews.</em>  It will lead to fast cython
code which is cleaner, more readable, and more easily debuggable than any other
alternative.</p>
